A CHARACTERIZATION OF PHYSICAL MEASURES FOR SYSTEMS WITH MIXED
CENTRAL BEHAVIOR
VITOR ARAUJO AND LUCIANA SALGADO
ABSTRACT. We show that the existence of physical measures for C
∞ smooth instances of certain partially hyperbolic dynamics, both continuous and discrete, exhibiting mixed behavior
(positive and negative Lyapunov exponents) along the central non-uniformly hyperbolic multidimensional invariant direction, is equivalent to the existence of certain types of “regular
points” on positive volume subsets, including Lyapunov regular points. This encompasses
the C
3
robust class of multidimensional non-hyperbolic attractors obtained by Viana, and the
C
1
robust classes of 3-sectionally hyperbolic wild strange attractors presented by Shilnikov
and Turaev, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of ergodic hyperbolic physical measures on these and other dynamical systems.

1. INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF RESULTS
The statistical viewpoint on Dynamical Systems is one of the cornerstones of most recent
developments in dynamics. Given a map f from a manifold M into itself, a central concept
is that of physical measure, a f-invariant probability measure µ whose ergodic basin
B(µ) = n
x ∈ M : lim n→+∞
1
n
Snφ(x) = Z
φ dµ, ∀φ ∈ C(M, R)
o
having positive volume or Lebesgue measure, where we write Snφ(x) = S
f
nφ(x) = ∑
n−1
j=0
φ(f
jx)
for the standard ergodic sum. In the continuous time case of a flow Xt generated by the
vector field X on the manifold M, this notion naturally translates to
B(µ) = n
x ∈ M : lim
T→+∞

T
Z T

φ(Xt(x)) = Z
φ dµ, ∀φ ∈ C(M, R)
o
has positive volume. This kind of measures provides asymptotic information on a set of
trajectories that one expects to be large enough to be observable in real-world models.
In particular, the existence of these measures implies that the subset
B :=

has positive volume for both the discrete case, and the continuous case with f = X1 the
time-1 map of a flow, where Snδx := ∑
n−1

. The existence of forward Birkhoff averages
for all continuous observables φ : M → R on a full Lebesgue measure subset of points is
known for all C
2 globally hyperbolic (Axiom A with no cycles) systems; see e.g. Bowen and
Ruelle [13, 14]. It is also well-known that this is not true in general; see e.g. Ruelle and
Takens [42, 44]. Moreover, as shown by Jiang, Liu and Qian [22], in this setting there exists
also a full Lebesgue measure subset of Lyapunov regular points; see e.g. Section 6 for more
details. In addition, this also holds for smooth Axiom A endomorphisms and hyperbolic
SRB measures [38].
Recently, it has been shown that, on the contrary, forward Birkhoff averages might not
exist on open subsets of points for locally dense subsets of smooth diffeomorphisms; see e.g.
Kiriki, Soma, Nakano, Li and Vargas [27, 25, 26]. Moreover, existence of Birkhoff averages
on positive volume subsets of points does not imply the existence of Lyapunov exponents
on the same subset, as shown by Kiriki, Li, Nakano, Soma [24], and it may happen that
the set of Lyapunov regular points has not full Lebesgue measure; see e.g. Ott [36]. In
[19], the second author together with Carvalho, Coelho and Varandas, proved more general
results on irregular sets with respect to Cesaro averages, including information on the Baire `
genericity of irregular sets for averages of semigroup actions that take into account the group
structure.
Here we explore some consequences of the assumption of existence of forward Birkhoff averages for all continuous observables on positive volume subsets of points together with existence
and regularity of Lyapunov exponents on the same subset of points, motivated by the above
PHYSICAL MEASURES WITH MIXED CENTRAL BEHAVIOR 3
mentioned features of Axiom A diffeomorphisms together with the results of Tsujii [45]; or
the assumption of pω-regular points on positive volume subsets from the results of Burguet [15],
applied to some robust examples of systems, both discrete and continuous.
We obtain necessary and sufficient condition on the existence of physical measures for
3-sectionally expanding attracting sets for smooth flows with center-unstable mixed behavior; and for partially hyperbolic attractors whose center direction exhibits non-uniformly
hyperbolic mixed behavior along the central direction. This means that, along certain multidimensional invariant directions, we have both positive and negative Lyapunov exponents
Lebesgue almost everywhere.
This provides a characterization of the existence of physical measure for the “wild strange
attractors” for singular flows from Shilnikov-Turaev [46]; and also for the C
∞ smooth instances of multidimensional non-uniformly expanding attractors from the class of diffeomorphisms obtained by Viana [47].
We note that mostly expanding/contracting behavior along multidimensional invariant
directions is enough to ensure the existence of physical measures, as shown by Alves, Bonatti
and Viana in [12, 2]; but no such general results are known for mixed behavior, among
non-conservative diffeomorphisms, along multidimensional invariant directions, apart from
the case of C
∞ surface diffeomorphisms by Burguet [16] (and Buzzi-Crovisier-Sarig [17]),
certain Henon maps [ ´ 10], and also certain dissipative skew-products perturbations of the
conservative Berger-Carrasco maps [11] studied by Carrasco and Obata [33, 18, 34].
2. THE DIFFEOMORPHISM CASE
We now present preliminary definitions and results. In what follows M is a compact
Riemannian manifold endowed with a Riemannian distance dist and volume form Leb .
2.1. Partial hyperbolicity with central dissipativeness. Let f : M ⟲ be a diffeomorphism
of M having an attractor Λ with a trapping region U (i.e. U is an open neighborhood of
Λ = Λf(U) := ∩n≥1 f
nU with f U ⊂ U) satisfying
(1) partial hyperbolicity: the tangent bundle TΛM over Λ splits into continuous D finvariant subbundles TΛM = E
s ⊕ E

such that there are constants C > 0, 0 <
λ < 1 satisfying for all x ∈ Λ and n ≥ 1

(b) E

(c) the splitting is dominated:

(2) dissipativeness along the central direction: | det(D f n

for all x ∈ Λ, n ≥
1.
We consider a continuous extension of each bundle of the splitting to U and assume, without
loss of generality, that the extended stable bundle is forward invariant [5], and also that dissipativeness and uniform expansion are preserved. We additionally assume the following.
(3) Non-uniform expansion along the central direction: there is c0 > 0 such that
lim supn→∞
log ∥D f n

1/n > c0, for Lebesgue a.e. x ∈ U. (2.1)

2.2. Some subsets of regular points. To state the main results, we recall some notions of
differential ergodic theory. As usual, we write log+
a = max{0, log a} for all a > 0 in what
follows. For a diffeomorphism f : M → M (or for the time-1 map f = X1 of a flow generated
by a vector field X), we set the forward Lyapunov exponent of v ∈ TxM \ {0} as
χ
+(x, v) := lim supn→∞
log ∥D f n
(x)v∥
1/n
.
The function χ(x, ·) admits finitely many values only χ

(x) ⊊ · · · ⊊ V1 = TxM with Vi(x) = {v ∈

(x)}. The functions p(x), χ
+
i
(x) are f-invariant; the vector spaces Vi(x),
i = 1, ..., p(x) are D f-invariant; and each of them depend Borel measurably on x.
We write χ

(x) := lim supn→∞
log+
∥D f n
(x)∥
1/n = max{χ(x, v) : v ∈ TxM \ {0}} for the
top Lyapunov exponent of the action of D f : TM → TM on the tangent bundle at x ∈ M.
We also set

for the top k-sectional Lyapunov exponents of the bundle morphism ∧D f induced by D f

Definition 1.11].
We finally set pω(x) the family of all weak∗ accumulation points of the empirical measures

, which is always a nonempty set of f-invariant probability measures on compact
ambient spaces like M. We say that x is pω-regular if

∧ dµ = χ

∧ (x).
We denote by P the subset of pω-regular points.
2.3. Main result for diffeomorphisms. In what follows, a hyperbolic ergodic physical measure
with central mixed behavior is a f-invariant probability measure µ such that for µ-a.e. x ∈
Λ and for x in a positive volume subset of U we have a positive and a negative central
Lyapunov exponent: there exists c0 > 0 so that
limn→∞ log ∥D f n
|Ec
x
∥
1/n > c0 and limn→∞ log ∥(D f n
|Ec
x
)
−1
∥
1/n > c0. (2.2)
Our first main result characterizes the existence of a physical probability measure µ with
mixed central behavior.
Theorem A. Let f : M → M be a C∞ diffeomorphism admitting a partially hyperbolic attracting
set Λ = Λf(U) satisfying conditions (1),(2) and (3) with a two-dimensional center subbundle.
Then there exists an hyperbolic ergodic physical with mixed central behavior if, and only if, the
subset P has positive volume in the trapping region U, i.e. Leb (P ∩ U) > 0.
2.4. An open class of examples. A C
r open set U of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms
with two-dimensional center bundle E
c
, in the setting of Theorem A, is provided by Viana
in [47] for r ≥ 3. Using the notation from [47], we consider the following skew-product
φα,b

is a solenoid embedding; and additionally
fα,b

, fα,b(Θ, X) = (a(θ) − x

where
• a(θ) = a0 + αω(θ) with
– a0 ∈ (1, 2) so that 0 is preperiodic for the map x 7→ a0 − x
2
;
– ω : S
1 → R, θ 7→ sin 2πθ is a Morse function; and
• I0 ⊂ (−2, 2) is a compact interval so that φα,b(T3 × I
2
0
) ⊂ int(T3 × I
2
0
) for every small
α, b > 0.
Hence, setting U := T3 × I
2
0 we get a diffeomorphism (into its image) φα,b
: U → U for
every b > 0. We note that det D fα,b = b and φα,b
is C
∞. Moreover, clearly we have a φα,b
-
invariant partially hyperbolic splitting TU = TB2 ⊕ TR2 ⊕ E
u
, where TB2 ⊕ E
u = TT3 is the
hyperbolic gˆ-invariant splitting of the standard Smale solenoid attractor, with E
u a graph
TS

, E
c = TR2
is the dissipative central direction of the skew-product, and
E
s = TB2
the uniformly contracting direction.
Theorem 2.1. [47, Theorem B] Let us assume d to be large enough. Then, there exists an open
set of (small positive) values of (α, b) for which f := φα,b admits a partially hyperbolic attractor
Λ = Λf(U) satisfying the conditions (1),(2) and (3) (with a two-dimensional center subbundle
and lim inf in the place of lim sup in (2.1)). Moreover the same holds for all φ in a neighborhood U
of φα,b
in C3
(U).
3. THE FLOW CASE
Recall that a trapping region U for a flow Xt
is an open subset of the manifold M which
satisfies: Xt(U) is contained in U for all t > 0, and there exists T > 0 such that Xt(U) is
contained in the interior of U for all t > T. We define Γ(U) = ΓX(U) := ∩t>0Xt(U) to be the
maximal positive invariant subset in the trapping region U.
A singularity for the vector field X is a point σ ∈ M such that X(σ) = 0 or, equivalently,
Xt(σ) = σ for all t ∈ R. The set formed by singularities is the singular set of X denoted
Sing(X). We say that a singularity is hyperbolic if the eigenvalues of the derivative DX(σ)
of the vector field at the singularity σ have nonzero real part.
3.1. Partial hyperbolicity. A dominated splitting over a compact invariant set Λ of X is a
continuous DXt-invariant splitting TΛM = E ⊕ F with Ex ̸= {0}, Fx ̸= {0} for every x ∈ Λ
and such that there are positive constants K, λ satisfying
∥DXt
|Ex
∥ · ∥DX−t
|FXt
(x)
∥ < Ke−λt
, for all x ∈ Λ, and all t > 0.
A compact invariant set Λ is said to be partially hyperbolic if it exhibits a dominated splitting TΛM = E ⊕ F such that
• E is uniformly contracted: there are C, λ > 0 so that ∥DXt
|Ex
∥ ≤ Ce−λt
for t ≥ 0 and all
x ∈ Λ.
In this case F is the central subbundle of Λ. Or else, we may replace uniform contraction along
E by
• F is uniformly expanded: there are C, λ > 0 so that ∥

DXt
|Fx
−1
∥ ≤ Ce−λt
for t ≥ 0
and all x ∈ Λ.
6 VITOR ARAUJO AND LUCIANA SALGADO
We can assume, without loss of generality, that a continuous extension of the stable direction
E of the splitting is still Dϕt-invariant [5] and consider also a continuous extension of the
center direction F to the trapping region U.
3.2. Sectional expansion/contraction. The following is an extension of the notion of 2-sectional
expansion proposed in [30, Definition 2.7].
Given E a vector space, we denote by ∧
pE the exterior power of order p of E, defined as
follows. If v1, . . . , vn is a basis of E then ∧
pE is generated by {vi1 ∧ · · · ∧vip
}1≤i≤n,ij̸=ik
,j̸=k
. Any
linear transformation A : E → F induces a transformation ∧
pA : ∧
pE → ∧pF. Moreover,
vi1 ∧ · · · ∧ vip
can be viewed as the p-plane generated by {vi1
, · · · , vip
} if ij ̸= ik
, j ̸= k.
Reciprocally, each p-plane Lx can be viewed as an element ve ∈ ∧p
(Fx) \ {0} of norm one.
Given a DXt-invariant subbundle F ⊂ TΛM such that dim Fx ≥ p is constant for x ∈ Λ,
we say that
• F is p-sectionally expanding if there exists c, λ > 0 so that for all x ∈ Λ and t ≥ 0 we
have ∥ ∧p

DXt(x) |Fx
−1
∥ ≤ ce−λt
.
• a DXt-invariant subbundle F ⊂ TΛM is mostly p-sectionally expanding if dim Fx ≥ p is
constant for x ∈ Λ and there exists c0 > 0 so that for Lebesgue almost every x ∈ U
lim supt→+∞
log |(∧
pDXt
|∧pFx
)|
1/t > c0. (3.1)
This means that for every p-dimensional linear subspace Lx ⊂ Fx one has
lim supt→+∞
log | det(DXt
|Lx
)|
1/t > c0. (3.2)
A mostly p-sectional-hyperbolic set is a partially hyperbolic set whose central subbundle is
mostly p-sectionally expanding – this extends the notion of sectional hyperbolicity given by
the second author in [43, Definition 3].
This is a particular case of the so called singular-hyperbolicity whose definition we recall
now. A DXt-invariant subbundle F ⊂ TΛM is said to be volume expanding if we replace (3.2)
by
| det(DXt
|Fx
)| > Ceλt
, for all t > 0.
A singular-hyperbolic set is a partially hyperbolic set whose central subbundle is volume
expanding [32, Definition 1]. Clearly, in the three-dimensional case, these notions are equivalent.
Remark 3.1. An invariant subbundle F which is 2-sectionally expanding and dim F ≥ 3,
is also p-sectionally expanding for each p = 3, . . . , dim F. However, the reciprocal is not
true, as shown by the open class of examples to be discussed in what follows, since sectional
contraction may occur in k-subspaces with k < p.
To encompass contracting behavior along F, we say that
• an invariant subbundle F of the tangent bundle TΛM is partially k-sectionally contracting if there are C, λ > 0 so that for every x ∈ Λ we can find a k-dimensional subspace
Lx ⊂ Fx for which
| det(DXt
|Lx
)| ≤ Ce−λt
, for all t > 0. (3.3)
PHYSICAL MEASURES WITH MIXED CENTRAL BEHAVIOR 7
• the (extended) central-subbundle of a partially hyperbolic splitting is mostly k-sectionally contracting if for Lebesgue almost every x ∈ U, there exists a k-dimensional
subspace Lx ⊂ Fx such that
lim supt→+∞
log | det(DXt
|Lx
)|
1/t < 0. (3.4)
3.3. Main result for flows. In what follows, we say that a Xt-invariant ergodic probability
measure µ is a hyperbolic ergodic physical with central mixed behavior if, for µ-a.e. x ∈ Λ and
for x in a positive volume subset of U we have a positive and a negative central Lyapunov
exponent: there exists c0 > 0 so that
limt→∞ log ∥DXt
|Fx
∥
1/t > c0 and limt→∞ log ∥(DXt
|Fx
)
−1
∥
1/t > c0.
We recall that P is the subset of pω-regular points.
Theorem B. Let X : M → TM be a C∞ vector field admitting an attracting set ΓX(U) which is
partially hyperbolic with dim F = 3, mostly 3-sectionally expanding (3.2) and 2-sectionally contracting (3.4); and all singularities are hyperbolic.
Then there exists an hyperbolic ergodic physical with mixed central behavior if, and only if, the
subset P has positive volume in the trapping region U, that is, we have Leb (P ∩ U) > 0.
3.4. An open class of examples. The following provides a C
1
robust family of vector fields
in the setting of Theorem B.
In [46], Turaev and Shilnikov construct a wild attractor Γ (see Figure 1) of a vector field
having a singular hyperbolic splitting TΓM = E ⊕ F, where dim F = 3 and dim E = n − 3 for
any n ≥ 4; and the attractor contains a (hyperbolic) saddle-focus singularity at the origin.
Moreover, the bundle F is 2-sectionally contracting; see [46, p 296, formula (13)] and more
recently [20] for other concrete examples of ODE’s displaying similar features.
FIGURE 1. Sketch of the trapping region of Turaev-Shil’nikov’s wild strange
attractor around the unfolding of a saddle-focus equilibrium at the origin.
These attractors are also robust: these properties persist for a C
1 neighborhood U of the
original vector field. This means that the subbundle F satisfies
• 3-sectional expansion, i.e. (3.2) (or just the volume along F, since dim F = 3) holds
for all x ∈ U for p = 3 and a fixed positive value of t; and also
8 VITOR ARAUJO AND LUCIANA SALGADO
• partial 2-sectional contraction, i.e. it satisfies (3.3): more precisely, there exist T >
0 so that for every x ∈ U we can find a 2-dimensional subspace Lx ⊂ Fx so that
| det(DXT |Lx
)| < 1.
Moreover, the C
1
robust property ensures that in U there exists a C
s dense subset of C
r vector
fields exhibiting the same properties, for 2 ≤ s ≤ r ≤ ∞.
4. AN ABSTRACT SETTING
Now we go back to the diffeomorphism f : M → M and recall that a point x ∈ M is
(positive) Lyapunov regular if, for all 1 ≤ k ≤ d, the sectional Lyapunov exponents satisfy
χ
k
(x) := lim supn→+∞
log ∥ ∧k D f n
(x)∥
1/n = ∑
k
i=1
χ
+
i
(x). (4.1)
By Oseledets’ Theorem [35], the set L of Lyapunov regular points has full measure for any
f-invariant probability measure.
Motivated by Tsujii [45], we say that x ∈ M is T-regular for f if x ∈ B (so that pω(x) =
{µx}) and x is pω-regular, and also Lyapunov regular (4.1) for µx, that is, we have χ
+
i
(x) =
χ
+
i
(y) for µx-a.e. y.
We denote by R = B ∩ L ∩ P the subset of T-regular points in what follows.
4.1. Unimodal sectional Lyapunov spectrum and existence of physical measures. We say
that the sectional Lyapunov spectrum of a point x ∈ M, given by χ
i
(x), i = 1, . . . , p(x), is
unimodal if there exists 1 ≤ k(x) < p(x) so that
χ
p(x)
(x) < · · · < χ
k(x)
(x) and χ
k(x)
(x) > · · · > χ
1
(x). (4.2)
If in addition x ∈ R, then the Lyapunov regularity ensures that the µx is hyperbolic, since
χ
+
1
(x) = χ
1
(x) and χ
+
i
(x) = χ
i
(x) − χ
i−1
(x), i = 2, . . . , d = dim M;
and thus χ
+
d
(x) ≤ · · · ≤ χ
+
k(x)+1
(x) < 0 < χ
+
k(x) ≤ · · · ≤ χ
+
1
(x).
When f = X1 is the time-1 map of a flow, then we allow for the zero Lyapunov exponent
along the flow direction: we say that x has unimodal sectional Lyapunov spectrum for a flow if
there exists 1 < k(x) < p(x) so that
χ
p(x)
(x) < · · · < χ
k(x)
(x) & χ
k(x)
(x) = χ
k(x)−1
(x) > · · · > χ
1
(x). (4.3)
The condition (4.2) or (4.3) is enough to obtain a physical/SRB measure for C
∞ maps
or flows assuming simultaneously that the collection of such points has positive volume inside the
family R of regular points. The reciprocal also holds true as a consequence of the work of Jiang
et al [22].
Theorem C. Let f : M → M be a C∞ diffeomorphism (e.g. the time-1 map of a flow Xt
induced by
a C∞ vector field). Then there exists an invariant hyperbolic ergodic physical probability measure
if, and only if, the subset S of points with unimodal spectrum has positive volume among the regular
points R, i.e. Leb (S ∩ R) > 0.
PHYSICAL MEASURES WITH MIXED CENTRAL BEHAVIOR 9
4.2. Open classes of examples. Among vector fields, a class that satisfies the assumptions
of Theorem C are the sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets for C
2 vector fields, which admit
physical measures; see e.g [4] and references therein. This includes, in particular, hyperbolic
attractors for C
2 vector fields [14] and all Lorenz-like vector fields [6].
Among diffeomorphisms, a class that satisfies the assumptions of Theorem C is the family
of non-uniformly hyperbolic attracting sets for C
2 diffeomorphisms with Holder-continuous ¨
splitting which, as shown in [31], admit physical measures. This class includes non-uniformly
partially hyperbolic attractors, as in [2], as well as hyperbolic attractors and Anosov diffeomorphisms.
For these classes we may specialize the statement of Theorem C as follows.

If Leb (R ∩ Ω) > 0, then there exists an ergodic hyperbolic invariant physical probability measure.
5. COMMENTS AND CONJECTURES
The statements Theorems A, B and C are corollaries of the results of Burguet [15], together
with the results from Jiang et al. from [22] on the extension of Lyapunov regularity along
stable manifolds, and the definition of regular point is inspired by the main results from
Tsujii [45]. The proofs are detailed in Section 6.
Remark 5.1 (Regularity, no hyperbolicity and no physical measure). We can have a full
Lebesgue measure subset of pω-regular and Lyapunov regular points without physical measure: consider the following skew-product on the 3-torus
T : T
3 → T
3
, (x, y, z) 7→ (x + y, y, h(z))
where h : S
1 ⟲ is the “North-South map”; see Figure 2. The restriction T0 := T |T2×{S}
to

in the circle.
the invariant 2-torus T2 × {S} is conservative and each circle S
1 × {y} × {S} is T0-invariant
for each given y ∈ S
1
. Moreover, the dynamics on these circles is a rotation: T0(x, y, S) =
(x + y, y, S), which preserves the Lebesgue length measure λ on each cicle. Hence, λ-a.e.

points are Lyapunov and pω-regular. Since this holds for all y, then we have that a.e. points
(x, y, S) are also regular with respect to the Lebesgue area measure on T2 × {S}.
In addition, all points (x, y, z) ∈ T3 with z ∈ S
1 \ {N} belong to the stable manifold of
(x, y, S). Thus, from Theorem 6.2, we have that a.e. point of T3 are Lyapunov and pωregular.
However, there is no ergodic physical measure for T, since all ergodic measures are the
Lebesgue length measures along the circles S
1 × {y} × {S} for λ-a.e. y ∈ S
1
(corresponding
to irrational rotations), whose ergodic basins are given by S
1 × {y} × (S
1 \ {N}), with zero
volume on T3
.
Finally, we note that the system is not hyperbolic: the Lyapunov exponents of T0 are all
null.
Corollary D yields a non-trivial result since, under the conditions of items (1) and (2), it
is known how to construct a cu-Gibbs state (or a hyperbolic SRB measure) following [2].
However, in general, these measures are not necessarily hyperbolic, as the following example shows.
Remark 5.2 (Existence of non-hyperbolic ergodic cu-Gibbs state). Indeed, we consider a pair
of diffeomorphisms f , g : S
1 × D ⟲, where f is the uniformly hyperbolic Smale solenoid
map, see e.g. [39, Sec. 7.7]; and g its “intermittent” modification [1, Sec. 4.6] from [3]. In
both cases we have attractors (i.e. transitive attracting sets) Λf
, Λg with partially hyperbolic
splitting E
s ⊕ E
cu and ergodic (in fact, mixing) hyperbolic cu-Gibbs states µf
, µg which are
the unique physical measures. However, f is uniformly hyperbolic, while g admits a fixed
point p ∈ Λg so that Dgp |Ecu is an isometry.
Hence, if ℓ > 1 is such that expansion/contraction rates of f
ℓ are stronger than the ones
of g, then F := f
ℓ × g is partially hyperbolic and ν = µf × µg is an ergodic F-invariant
measure which is the unique physical measure and a cu-Gibbs state. Thus, F is nonuniformly
hyperbolic on a full volume measure subset of (S
1 × D)
2 and the attractor Λ := Λf × Λg
admits the partially hyperbolic splitting TΛM =

E
s
f ⊕ E
s
g

⊕

E
cu
g ⊕ E


. However, the
ergodic cu-Gibbs state ν = µf × δp is non-hyperbolic, with a zero Lyapunov exponent along
the direction E
cu
g
. This shows that even with a full volume of non-uniformly hyperbolic points and
unique physical/SRB measure, there can be ergodic cu-Gibbs states which are not hyperbolic.
We note that the central bundle dynamics of the skew-products φα,b
in the statement of
Theorem 2.1 is a perturbation of the Henon family [ ´ 21]. For this polynomial family of dissipative maps, a positive Lebesgue measure of parameters was obtained by Benedicks and
Carleson [9] for which the system is non-uniform expanding, that is, condition (3) is satisfied. The recent results for C
∞ smooth surface dynamics of Burguet [16] would automatically ensure the existence and uniqueness of a physical measure for these system, which
was obtained with a completely different strategy, specifically adapted to these systems, by
Benedicks and Young [10].
The conditional existence results of physical measures stated in Theorems A and B, together with the positive results on “Takens last problem” [27], naturally raise the following
questions.
Conjecture 1. For a dense/generic subset of dynamical systems, there exists a positive volume subset in the ambient space where at least one of the following properties hold:
(1) the points are pω-regular;
PHYSICAL MEASURES WITH MIXED CENTRAL BEHAVIOR 11
(2) forward Birkhoff averages exist on all points;
(3) forward Lyapunov exponents exist and are Lyapunov regular.
This would automatically provide for the existence of physical measures among the smooth
systems in the open classes of non-uniformly hyperbolic flows and diffeomorphims described in the previous subsection, and provide for a criterion to obtain physical/SRB measures using the sectional Lyapunov spectrum.
Since Hertz, Hertz, Tahzibi and Ures [40] have shown the uniqueness of SRB measures
for transitive diffeomorphisms on surfaces, and Obata [34] obtained uniqueness for nonconservative perturbations of certain skew-products with two-dimensional center bundle
with mixed behavior, the fact that the non-hyperbolic center direction of the family φα,b
is
two-dimensional suggests the following.
Conjecture 2. There exists at most one SRB/physical measure for each of the maps φα,b
in
the setting of Theorem A.
Assuming a positive answer to the previous conjectures, it is natural to consider the dependence of the physical measure on the dynamics of the open families U of maps considered
in Subsections 2.4 and 3.4. Ideally we would like to obtain statistical stability, that is, if µn is
the physical measure for the dynamics of fn, and fn converges to f ∈ U in some C
r
topology
(2 ≤ r ≤ ∞), then µn weakly converges to a f-invariant probability measure µ, which is also
a physical measure for f .
Conjecture 3. The physical measures of the C
∞ dynamics in U are statistically stable.
This would naturally lead to obtain physical measures for most dynamics among the open
classes of systems considered here. A natural extension of this work is to study statistical
properties (e.g. mixing and speed of mixing) of these physical measures.

6. PHYSICAL MEASURES FOR SMOOTH SYSTEMS
We present first the main result from Burguet [15], involving the subset P, needed to obtain
the main statements.
Theorem 6.1. [15, Main Theorem] Let there be given a C∞ map f : M → M. Then for Lebesgue
almost every point x there exists µx ∈ pω(x) such that hµx
(f) ≥ χ
+
∧ (x).
We note that, in the setting of Theorem 6.1, we obtain for Leb -a.e. x ∈ P
χ
+
∧ (x) ≤ hµx
(f) ≤

∧ dµx = χ
+(µ) ≤ sup

Z
χ
+
∧ dµ = χ
+
∧ (x),

where the last inequality is given by pω-regularity of µx, and we used the Ruelle Inequality [41] for the entropy hν(f) ≤
R
χ
+
∧ dν for any f-invariant probability measure ν. Therefore,
µx satisfies the Pesin Entropy Formula hµx
(f) = R
χ
+
∧ dµx.
In the setting of the Main Theorems, we have at least a positive Lyapunov exponent, thus
we can find an ergodic component of µx still satisfying the Entropy Formula with positive
entropy – we keep the notation µx in what follows.
We recall that the stable (unstable) manifold of a point x ∈ M is the subset of points whose
future (past) orbits approach the orbit of x exponentially fast:
Ws
x
:= {y ∈ M : lim supn→+∞
(1/n)log dist
f

< 0}; and
Wu
x
:= {y ∈ M : lim supn→−∞
(1/n)log dist
f
n
(y), f
n
(x)

< 0}.
It it well-known that, under some hyperbolicity conditions, such subsets are immersed differentiable submanifolds of M; see e.g. [8]. In what follows, given a subset V ⊂ M, we write
Ws
(V) = ∪{Ws
x
: x ∈ V}.
From the results of Ledrappier and Young [28], the measures µx satisfying the Pesin Entropy Formula with positive entropy are Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measures, which are dynamically characterized as µx-almost every point has a positive Lyapunov exponent and the disintegration of µ along the unstable manifolds is absolutely continuous with respect to the volume on the
unstable manifolds inherited from the Riemannian structure on the ambient manifold.
From Pesin’s Nonuniformly Hyperbolic Theory, it is known that any ergodic hyperbolic
SRB measure is physical [37, 8]. Consequently if, in addition, µx has no zero Lyapunov
exponents (or only one zero Lyapunov exponent along the direction of the flow), then µx
becomes a physical measure.
Next we present a result from Jiang et al [22] enabling us to show that existence of physical/SRB measures implies Lyapunov and pω-regularity for a subset of point with positive
volume; see also [23, Chapter 8].
Theorem 6.2. [22, Theorem 5.3] Let f : M → M be a C2 diffeomorphism and µ an f -ergodic
probability measure on M satisfying:
(i) µ is hyperbolic, that is, f has almost no zero Lyapunov exponents with respect to µ;
(ii) µ has absolutely continuous conditional measures on unstable manifolds or, equivalently, Pesin’s entropy formula hµ(f) = R
χ
+
∧ dµ holds true for the system (M, f , µ).
Let L = L(µ) be the set of Lyapunov regular points which are contained in B(µ). Then Leb (Ws
(L)) >
0 and Ws
(L) ⊂ L ∩ B(µ).
That is, each point y ∈ Ws
(L) is Lyapunov regular: χ
+
i
(y) = χ

(x) and χ

(y) = χ

for y ∈ Ws
x and x ∈ L. Moreover, for µ-a.e. x we also get µ = limn→+∞

n ∑
n−1
k=0

.
Remark 6.3 (Lyapunov and pω-regularity). This ensures that y ∈ Ws
x
is also pω-regular for
x ∈ L ∩ B(µ). Indeed, since µ is f-invariant and ergodic, then pω(y) = {µ} and hµ(f) =
R
χ
+
∧ dµ = χ
+(x) for µ-a.e. x, which is contained in B(µ) ∩ L, and also χ
+
∧ (y) = χ
+
∧ (x) from
Theorem 6.2. Thus hµ(f) = χ
+(y). Comparing with [15, Remark 5] on “Bowen’s figure 8
example” and Remark 5.1 we see that condition (ii) in the statement of Theorem 6.2 is key
to obtain positive volume of pω-regular points.
Hence, we only need to prove the necessary condition in the statements of the main theorems, since the existence of a physical hyperbolic ergodic measure µ, which also satisfies
PHYSICAL MEASURES WITH MIXED CENTRAL BEHAVIOR 13
the entropy formula, automatically ensures pω-regularity and T-regularity for a positive
Lebesgue measure subset inside the ergodic basin of µ.
6.1. Proof of the diffeomorphism case. A consequence of the assumptions of Theorem A
and Theorem 6.1, is that for a C
∞ map f and x ∈ U ∩ P, we have that µx is an SRB measure.
To conclude the statement of Theorem A it is enough to show that µx is hyperbolic with
mixed behavior along the central direction.
Let then µx be an SRB measure with x ∈ U satisfying (2.1). Since TΛM = E
s ⊕ E
c ⊕ E
u and
E
s
is uniformly contracting, E
u
is uniformly expanding, and E
c
is two-dimensional and area

u and n ≥ 1 we get

and so χ

x u∥,
where ≈ means equality up to a bounded multiplicative constant. From (2.1) we can find
v ∈ E
c
x
so that χ
+(x, v) > c0 > 0 and from (6.1) we can find u ∈ ∧duE
u
x which realizes the
rate of volume growth along E
u
, so we obtain χ
du+1
(x) = χ

du+1
(x) + χ
du (x) > χ
du (x) + c0 >
χ
du (x). Moreover,
∥ ∧du+2 D f n

(D f n

(D f n

∥ ∧du
(D f n
|Eu

and therefore we conclude that χ
du+2
(x) < χ
du (x) + log λ < χ
du + c0 < χ
du+1
(x).
In addition, since E
s
is uniformly contracting, then we also get χ
du+2+i+1
(x) < χ
du+2+i
(x)
for all i = 0, . . . , dim E
s
. This ensures that χ
du+1
(x) = χ

∧ (x) = hµx
(f). Thus, µx is hyperbolic
with a Lyapunov spectrum satisfying
χ
+
du+2
(x) = χ
du+2
(x) − χ
du+1
(x) < log λ − c0 < 0 < c0 < χ
+
du+1
(x)
Hence, the minimal exponent along the subbundle E
c
x
is smaller than log λ − c0. This concludes the proof of Theorem A.
6.2. Proof of the flow case. Similarly, to conclude the statement of Theorem B it is enough
to show that µx is hyperbolic with mixed behavior along the central direction for Leb -a.e.
x ∈ U ∩ P and a C
∞ vector field X. Then, from 3-sectional expansion, we obtain
χ

(x) + χ

(x) + χ

(x) ≥ χ

(x) > 0,
which ensures that χ
+
1
(x) > 0. Since the hyperbolic singularities within U are hyperbolic
and are fixed points of the dynamics, then they belong to Γ and the sectional expansion
assumption ensures that each singularity is of saddle-type. Hence, the union of the stable
manifold of the singularities has zero volume1
, and so Leb -a.e. x ∈ U has a zero Lyapunov
exponent along the flow direction. Moreover, the flow direction is contained in F due to the
following.
Lemma 6.4. [7, Lemma 3.2] Let Λ be a compact invariant set for the vector field X.

Since the stable manifold of a hyperbolic critical element in an immersed submanifold [39], then it has zero
volume as a subset of the ambient manifold

(1) Given a continuous splitting TΛM = E ⊕ F such that E is uniformly contracted, then
X(x) ∈ Fx for all x ∈ Λ.
(2) Assuming that Λ is non-trivial and has a continuous and dominated splitting TΛM =
E ⊕ F such that X(x) ∈ Fx for all x ∈ Λ, then E is a uniformly contracted subbundle.
In addition, from 2-sectional contraction, we get that there exists v ∈ Fx \ {0} so that
χ
+(x, v) < 0, and thus we conclude that χ

(x) < 0 = χ

(x).
This shows that χ

∧ (x) = χ

(x) = χ

(x), that µ = µx is hyperbolic (since E is uniformly
contracted) and, consequently, a physical measure with mixed central behavior for the time-1
map of the flow.
The probability measure ν :=
R 1
0
(Xt)∗µ dt is Xt-invariant for every t > 0 and also ergodic
for the flow. Moreover, if φ : M → R is continuous and x ∈ B(µ), then ψ =

φ ◦ Xs ds is
also continuous, and since Xt and f commute

where the last equality follows from boundedness of φ. This shows that B(µ) ⊂ B(ν) and so
ν is a physical measure for the flow.
This completes the proof of Theorem B since, for µ-a.e. y ∈ B(µ) ∩ U ⊂ B(ν) ∩ U

Remark 6.5. Up to this point in this section we have not assumed that x is Lyapunov regular.
6.3. Proof of the abstract result. To prove Theorem C, we note that, by assumption, we can
find x ∈ R which is simultaneously pω-regular, Lyapunov regular and has unimodal sectional Lyapunov spectrum, so that the measure µx ∈ pω(x), given by Theorem 6.1, satisfies
Pesin’s Entropy Formula hµx
(f) = R
χ
+
∧ dµx.
From Ergodic Decomposition [29, Chapter II, Section 6] and Jacobs’ Theorem [48, Theorem
9.6.2] we can assume without loss of generality that µx is ergodic (otherwise, there exists an
ergodic component which also satisfies Pesin’s Entropy Formula) and is hyperbolic (since
the Lyapunov exponents χ
+
i
(x) coincide with the exponents χ
+
i
(y) for µx-a.e. y). Hence, µx
is a hyperbolic ergodic physical measure as claimed. This completes the proof of Theorem C.
For Corollary D, we just have to note that for x ∈ Ω ∩ R the following limits exist and are
bounded as follows

This ensures that points in Ω ∩ R have unimodal spectrum. Thus, the system satisfies the
conditions of Theorem C on a positive Lebesgue measure subset, and the conclusion follows.

Paper 2: 
SRB measures for partially hyperbolic systems
whose central direction is mostly expanding ∗
Jos´e F. Alves, Christian Bonatti, Marcelo Viana
Abstract
We construct Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measures supported on partially hyperbolic sets of diffeomorphisms – the tangent bundle splits into
two invariant subbundles, one of which is uniformly contracting – under
the assumption that the complementary subbundle is non-uniformly expanding. If the rate of expansion (Lyapunov exponents) is bounded away
from zero, then there are only finitely many SRB measures.
Our techniques extend to other situations, including certain maps with
singularities or critical points, as well as diffeomorphisms having only a
dominated splitting (and no uniformly hyperbolic subbundle).
1 Introduction
The following approach has been most effective in studying the dynamics of complicated systems: one tries to describe the average time spent by typical orbits
in different regions of the phase space. According to the ergodic theorem of
Birkhoff, such times are well defined for almost all point, with respect to any
invariant probability measure. However, the notion of typical orbit is usually
meant in the sense of volume (Lebesgue measure), which is not always captured
by invariant measures. Indeed, it is a fundamental open problem to understand
under which conditions the behaviour of typical points is well defined, from this
statistical point of view.
This problem can be precisely formulated by means of the following notion,
introduced by Sinai, Ruelle, and Bowen. Let us consider discrete time systems,
namely maps f : M → M on a manifold M. Given an f-invariant Borelian

probability µ in M, we call basin of µ the set B(µ) of the points x ∈ M such that
the averages of Dirac measures along the orbit of x converge to µ in the weak∗
sense:
lim n→+∞

n
Xn−1
j=0
ϕ(f
j
(x)) = Z
ϕ dµ for any continuous ϕ : M → R. (1)
Then we say that µ is a physical or Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure for f
if the basin B(µ) has positive Lebesgue measure in M. Then, one would like
to know whether, for most systems, the basins of all SRB measures cover a full
Lebesgue measure subset of the whole manifold.
This question has an affirmative answer in the context of uniformly hyperbolic systems, after [Sin72], [BR75], [Bow75], [Rue76]. A detailed picture is also
available for maps of the circle or the interval, see [Jak81], [Lyu]. However, in
higher dimensions the problem is mostly open, outside the uniformly hyperbolic
setting, despite substantial progress in the study of certain classes of maps and
flows with some properties of non-uniform hyperbolicity, including the Lorenzlike attractors, see e.g. [Pes92], [Sat92], [Tuc99], and the H´enon-like attractors,
see [BC91], [BY92], [BV].
In this work we deal with diffeomorphisms admitting partially hyperbolic invariant sets: the tangent bundle over the set has an invariant dominated splitting
into two subbundles, one of which is uniformly hyperbolic (contracting or expanding). Precise definitions are given in the next subsection. This property
yields a fair amount of geometric information, e.g. invariant foliations, so that it
is natural to try to recover for these systems as much as possible of the geometric
and ergodic properties of the hyperbolic ones.
Indeed, some knowledge of such properties is already available, through works
of several authors. For the foundations concerning invariant foliations see [BP74],
[HPS77]. Gibbs u-states were constructed by [PS82], and used by [You90],
[Car93], [BV99] to construct SRB measures for some types of partially hyperbolic systems. SRB measures and decay of correlations were also studied by
[Alv97], [Cas98], [Dol]. Moreover, [Shu71], [Ma˜n78], [GPS94], [Kan94], [BD96],
[Via97], [SW] constructed examples where partial hyperbolicity is used to get
robustness (stability) of topological or ergodic properties, which is also a main
topic in [BP74]. Conversely, [Ma˜n82], [DPU99], [BDP], showed that partial hyperbolicity (or, in high dimensions, existence of a dominated splitting) is in fact
a necessary condition for robust topological transitivity.
The interest in this class of systems was further stressed by these recent results, that suggest that partial hyperbolicity (or, at least, existence of a dominated
splitting) should be a crucial ingredient in a global theory of Dynamics. A program towards such a theory has been proposed a few years ago by [Pal99], the
2
cornerstone of which is a conjecture containing the following statement: every
system can be approximated by one having finitely many SRB measures, whose
basins cover a full Lebesgue measure subset of the phase space.
In the present paper we obtain results of existence and finiteness of SRB
measures for a large class of partially hyperbolic maps. Previous constructions
depended on the existence of a uniformly expanding (strong-unstable) invariant
subbundle. In fact, except for the situation of [Via97], [Alv97], the SRB measures
coincide with the Gibbs u-states (invariant measures absolutely continuous in
the strong-unstable direction) constructed by [PS82]. As shown in [BV99], this
happens whenever the central subbundle is (at least) non-uniformly contracting.
One main novelty here is that we do not assume existence of a strong-unstable
direction. Using only a condition of non-uniform expansion in an invariant
(centre-unstable) subbundle, we are able to construct invariant measures absolutely continuous in this centre-unstable direction. Actually, this does not even
require the full strength of partial hyperbolicity, it suffices to have a dominated
splitting. In some cases, these Gibbs cu-states are SRB measures: in particular,
this is always the case if the complementary subbundle is uniformly contracting
on the support of the measure.
1.1 Partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms
Let f : M → M be a C
1 diffeomorphism on a manifold M. Here we say that a
compact set K ⊂ M is partially hyperbolic for f if it is positively invariant, i.e.
f(K) ⊂ K, and there exists a continuous Df-invariant splitting TKM = E
ss⊕E
cu
of the tangent bundle restricted to K and a constant λ < 1 satisfying (for some
choice of a Riemannian metric on M)
1. E
ss is uniformly contracting: kDf | E
ss
x k ≤ λ for all x ∈ K;
2. E
cu is dominated by E
ss: kDf | E
ss
x k · kDf −1
| E
cu
f(x)
k ≤ λ for all x ∈ K.
We call E
ss strong-stable subbundle and E
cu centre-unstable subbundle.
Theorem A. Let f : M → M be a C
2 diffeomorphism having a partially hyperbolic set K. Assume that f is non-uniformly expanding along the centre-unstable
direction, meaning that
lim sup
n→+∞
1
n
Xn
j=1
log kDf −1
| E
cu
f
j (x)
k < 0 (2)
for all x in a positive Lebesgue measure set H ⊂ K. Then f has some ergodic
SRB measure with support contained in ∩
∞
j=0f
j
(K). In fact, Lebesgue almost
every point in H belongs in the basin of some such SRB measure.
3
As we shall explain below, for the proof it is enough to have condition (2) on
a positive Lebesgue measure subset of some disk transverse to the strong-stable
direction.
The SRB measures produced by this theorem have dim E
cu positive Lyapunov
exponents and dim E
ss negative Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, they have absolutely continuous conditional measures along corresponding Pesin unstable manifolds (which are tangent to the centre-unstable subbundle E
cu at almost every
point).
We ignore whether the conclusion of Theorem A remains true if the nonuniform expansion condition is replaced by
lim sup
n→+∞
1
n
log kDf −n
| E
cu
fn(x)k < 0 (3)
(i.e. positivity of all the Lyapunov exponents in the centre-unstable direction).
Clearly, the two formulations (2) and (3) are equivalent when the non-uniformly
expanding direction is 1-dimensional, that is, when E
cu can be split as E
c ⊕ E
uu
with E
c having dimension 1 and E
uu being uniformly expanding. Let us also
note that for a set of points with full probability (full measure with respect to
any invariant probability measure) condition (3) implies condition (2) for some
f
k
, k ≥ 1. Of course, the theorem is not affected when f is replaced by any
positive iterate of it.
As a consequence of the proof of the theorem we also get
Corollary B. Under the assumptions of Theorem A, if the limit in (2) is bounded
away from zero, then the set H is contained in the union of the basins of finitely
many SRB measures, up to a zero Lebesgue measure subset.
These results have the following curious consequence: in the setting of Theorem A the set of values of the limit in (2) over a full Lebesgue measure subset of
H is discrete, with zero as the unique possible accumulation value.
The assumption of partial hyperbolicity in Theorem A can be somewhat relaxed, as we explain in Section 6. Assuming only the existence of a dominated
splitting E
cs ⊕ E
cu with E
cu non-uniformly expanding, we prove that the diffeomorphism admits invariant probability measures with absolutely continuous
conditional measures along the centre-unstable direction. This may be thought
of as a non-uniform version of the results of [PS82] on existence of Gibbs u-states.
We also show that in some cases where E
cs is non-uniformly contracting these
invariant measures are SRB measures for the corresponding system.
1.2 Maps with singular sets
Similar methods allow us to construct SRB measures for certain maps with singularities and/or critical points. Apart from a condition of non-uniform expansion
4
on a positive Lebesgue measure subset H, similar to (2), we also need the points
of H not to spend most of the time too close to the singular set. This is properly
expressed in (6) below. Before that, let us explain what we mean by singular set
of a map.
Let M be a compact manifold, S ⊂ M a compact subset, and f : M \ S → M
a C
2 map on M \ S. We assume that f behaves like a power of the distance to
S close to the singular set S, in the following sense: there exist constants B > 1
and β > 0 such that
(S1) 1
B
dist(x, S)
β ≤
kDf(x)vk
kvk
≤ B dist(x, S)
−β
;
(S2) | log kDf(x)
−1
k − log kDf(y)
−1
k | ≤ B
dist(x, y)
dist(x, S)
β
;
(S3) | log | det Df(x)| − log | det Df(y)| | ≤ B
dist(x, y)
dist(x, S)
β
;
for every v ∈ TxM and x, y ∈ M \ S with dist(x, y) < dist(x, S)/2.
Given δ > 0 and x ∈ M \ S we define the δ-truncated distance from x to S
distδ(x, S) = 
1 if dist(x, S) ≥ δ
dist(x, S) otherwise.
(4)
Note that this is not really a distance function: dist(x, y) + distδ(y, S) may be
smaller than distδ(x, S). We also denote S∞ = ∪
∞
n=0f
n
(S).
Theorem C. Assume that f satisfies (S1), (S2), (S3) and is non-uniformly expanding, in the sense that
lim sup
n→+∞
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
log kDf(f
j
(x))−1
k < 0 (5)
for all x in a positive Lebesgue measure set H ⊂ M \ S∞. Assume moreover that,
given any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for every x ∈ H
lim sup
n→+∞
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
− log distδ(f
j
(x), S) ≤ ε. (6)
Then Lebesgue almost every point in H belongs in the basin of some ergodic
absolutely continuous invariant measure.
As a by-product, corresponding to the case when the singular set is empty,
5
Corollary D. Let f : M → M be a C
2
covering map (local diffeomorphism) on
a compact manifold M, which is non-uniformly expanding: (5) holds for all x
in a set H ⊂ M with positive Lebesgue measure. Then Lebesgue almost every
point x ∈ H belongs in the basin of some ergodic absolutely continuous invariant
measure.
In the settings of these last two results, we also have an analogue of Corollary B: if the limit in (5) is bounded away from zero then H is covered by the
basins of finitely many ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measures. See
also the comments at the end of Section 5 concerning similar results for partially
hyperbolic maps with singularities.
For unimodal maps of the interval with negative Schwarzian derivative, results
in a similar spirit had been obtained by [Led81] and [Kel90]. In particular, [Kel90]
contains a strong version of Corollary D for such maps.
This paper is organized as follows. To construct the SRB measures in Theorem A we fix any C
2 disk transverse to the strong-stable direction and intersecting
H on a positive Lebesgue measure subset, and we consider the sequence of averages of forward iterates of Lebesgue measure restricted to such a disk. We prove,
in Section 3, that a definite fraction of each average corresponds to a measure
that is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure along the iterates of the disk, with uniformly bounded densities. This uses distortion bounds
that we obtain in Section 2, together with the key notion of hyperbolic times,
first introduced in [Alv97]. The construction of the SRB measures is completed
in Section 4, where we show that the absolute continuity property passes to the
limit. In Section 4 we also obtain enough information about the basins of these
measures to prove the finiteness statement in Corollary B.
In Section 5 we explain how condition (6) allows us to bypass the difficulty
caused by the presence of singularities, and obtain Theorem C and Corollary D,
as well as the results on partially hyperbolic maps with singularities that we
mentioned before. Section 6 contains related results for systems with a dominated
splitting E
cs⊕E
cu where neither of the factors needs have any uniform subbundle,
that we also mentioned above. In the Appendix we give a few simple criteria
allowing to check the assumptions of our results in specific situations.
2 Curvature and distortion
A first main step in the proof of Theorem A is to prove a bounded distortion
property for iterates of f over disks whose tangent space is contained in a centreunstable cone at each point. This section is devoted to the precise statement and
proof of this property.
6
Remark 2.1. Throughout this section, as well as in Section 3 and Subsection 4.1,
we do not need the full strength of partial hyperbolicity. In Subsection 2.1 we only
use existence of a dominated splitting E
cs ⊕ E
cu. Subsections 2.2 and 2.3, Section 3, and Subsection 4.1 depend also on the condition of non-uniform expansion
along the centre-unstable direction (2). Existence of a strong-stable subbundle
E
ss is used for the first time in Subsection 4.2.
We fix continuous extensions of the two subbundles E
cs and E
cu to some
neighbourhood V0 of K, that we denote E˜cs and E˜cu. It should be noted that we
do not require these extensions to be invariant under Df. Then, given 0 < a < 1,
we define the centre-unstable cone field C
cu
a = (C
cu
a
(x))x∈V0
of width a by
C
cu
a
(x) = {v1 + v2 ∈ E˜cs
x ⊕ E˜cu
x
such that kv1k ≤ akv2k}. (7)
We define the centre-stable cone field C
cs
a = (C
cs
a
(x))x∈V0
of width a in a similar
way, just reversing the roles of the subbundles in (7).
We fix a > 0 and V0 small enough so that, up to slightly increasing λ < 1, the
domination condition 2. in Subsection 1.1 remains valid for any pair of vectors
in the two cone fields:
kDf(x)v
csk · kDf −1
(f(x))v
cuk ≤ λkv
csk kv
cuk
for every v
cs ∈ C
cs
a
(x), v
cu ∈ C
cu
a
(f(x)), and any point x ∈ V0∩f
−1
(V0). Note that
the centre-unstable cone field is positively invariant: Df(x)C
cu
a
(x) ⊂ C
cu
a
(f(x))
whenever x and f(x) are in V0. Indeed, the domination property together with
the invariance of E
cu = (E˜cu | K) imply
Df(x)C
cu
a
(x) ⊂ C
cu
λa(f(x)) ⊂ C
cu
a
(f(x)),
for every x ∈ K, and this extends to any x ∈ V0 ∩ f
−1
(V0) by continuity.
Wherever we presume E
cs to be uniformly contracting (as already mentioned,
this will happen not happen before Subsection 4.2), we denote it by E
ss instead,
and represent by E˜ss its extension to V0. Moreover, in that case the cone field
C
cs
a
is denoted C
ss
a
, and called strong-stable.
2.1 H¨older control of the tangent direction
We say that an embedded C
1
submanifold N ⊂ V0 is tangent to the centreunstable cone field C
cu
a
if the tangent subspace to N at each point x ∈ N is
contained in the corresponding cone C
cu
a
(x). Then f(N) is also tangent to the
centre-unstable cone field, if it is contained in V0.
The tangent bundle of N is said to be H¨older continuous if x 7→ TxN defines
a H¨older continuous section from N to the corresponding Grassman bundle of
7
M. In this subsection we show that the tangent bundle of the iterates of a C
2
submanifold are H¨older continuous (as long as they do not leave V0 ), with uniform
H¨older constants.
The basic idea is contained in the following observation, which the reader may
easily check. Let E1, E2 be two Euclidean spaces and L be a linear isomorphism
on E1 ⊕ E2 leaving both factors invariant. Assume that we have the domination
property
kL | E1k · kL
−1
| E2k < 1.
Then there exist C > 0 and 0 < ζ ≤ 1 such that if Γ ⊂ E1 ⊕ E2 is the graph of a
C
1+ζ map φ : E1 → E2, with H¨older constant C, then the same is true for L(Γ).
In fact, it suffices to take any ζ such that kL | E1k · kL
−1
| E2k
1+ζ < 1.
In order to apply similar arguments in our situation, it is useful to express the
notion of H¨older variation of the tangent bundle in local coordinates, as follows.
We choose δ0 > 0 small enough so that the inverse of the exponential map
expx
is defined on the δ0 neighbourhood of every point x in V0. From now on we
identify this neighbourhood of x with the corresponding neighbourhood Ux of the
origin in TxN, through the local chart defined by exp−1
x
. Accordingly, we identify
x with 0 ∈ TxN. Reducing δ0, if necessary, we may suppose that E˜cs
x
is contained
in the centre-stable cone C
cs
a
(y) of every y ∈ Ux. In particular, the intersection of
C
cu
a
(y) with E˜cs
x
reduces to the zero vector. Then, the tangent space to N at y is
parallel to the graph of a unique linear map Ax(y) : TxN → E˜cs
x
. Given constants
C > 0 and 0 < ζ ≤ 1, we say that the tangent bundle to N is (C, ζ)-H¨older if
kAx(y)k ≤ Cdx(y)
ζ
for every y ∈ N ∩ Ux and x ∈ V0 . (8)
Here, dx(y) denotes the distance from x to y along N ∩ Ux, defined as the length
of the shortest curve connecting x to y inside N ∩ Ux.
Recall that we have chosen the neighbourhood V0 and the cone width a sufficiently small so that the domination property remains valid for vectors in the
cones C
cs
a
(z), C
cu
a
(z), and for any point z in V0. Then, there exist λ1 ∈ (λ, 1) and
ζ ∈ (0, 1] such that
kDf(z)v
csk · kDf −1
(f(z))v
cuk
1+ζ ≤ λ1 < 1 (9)
for every norm 1 vectors v
cs ∈ C
cs
a
(z) and v
cu ∈ C
cu
a
(z), at any z ∈ V0. Then, up
to reducing δ0 > 0 and slightly increasing λ1 < 1, (9) remains true if we replace
z by any y ∈ Ux, x ∈ V0 (taking k · k to mean the Riemannian metric in the
corresponding local chart).
We fix ζ and λ1 as above in all that follows. Then, given a C
1
submanifold
N ⊂ V0, we denote
κ(N) = inf{C > 0 : the tangent bundle of N is (C, ζ)-H¨older}. (10)
8
Proposition 2.2. There exist λ0 < 1 and C0 > 0 so that if N ⊂ V0 ∩ f
−1
(V0) is
any C
1
submanifold tangent to the centre-unstable cone field then
κ(f(N)) ≤ λ0 κ(N) + C0 .
Proof. Of course, we only need to consider the case when κ(N) is finite, that is,
the tangent bundle of N is (C, ζ)-H¨older for some C > 0. Let x ∈ N be fixed. We
use (u, s) ∈ TxN ⊕E˜cs
x
and (u1, s1) ∈ Tf(x)f(N)⊕E˜cs
f(x)
, respectively, to represent
the local coordinates in Ux and Uf(x)
introduced above. We write the expression
of our map in these local coordinates as f(u, s) = (u1(u, s), s1(u, s)). Observe
that if x ∈ K then the partial derivatives of u1 and s1 at the origin 0 ∈ TxN are
∂uu1(0) = Df|TxN, ∂su1(0) = 0, ∂us1(0) = 0, ∂ss1(0) = Df|E˜cs
x
.
This is because E
cs
x = E˜cs
x
is mapped to E
cs
f(x) = E˜cs
f(x)
under Df(x) and, similarly,
TxN is mapped to Tf(x)N. Then, given any small ε0 > 0 we have that
k∂uu1(y) − Df|TxNk, k∂su1(y)k, k∂us1(y)k, k∂ss1(y) − Df|E˜cs
x k, (11)
are all less than ε0 for every x ∈ V0 and y ∈ Ux, as long as δ0 and V0 are small.
Taking the cone width a also small, we get
kDf|TyN − Df|E˜cu
x k ≤ ε0 and kDf −1
|Tf(y)f(N) − Df −1
|E˜cu
f(x)k ≤ ε0 , (12)
for every x ∈ V0 and y ∈ Ux. Since f is C
2
, there is also some constant K2 > 0
such that
k∂su1(y)k ≤ K2dx(y) and k∂us1(y)k ≤ K2dx(y). (13)
For y1 in Uf(x)
, let Af(x)(y1) be the linear map from Tf(x)f(N) to E˜cs
f(x) whose
graph is parallel to Ty1
f(N). We are going to prove that, fixing ε0 sufficiently
small, then Af(x)(y1) satisfies (8) for any C > λ0κ(N) + C0, with convenient λ0
and C0. Let us begin by noting that kAf(x)(y1)k is bounded by some uniform
constant K1 > 0, since f(N) is tangent to the centre-unstable cone field. We
will choose the constant C0 ≥ K1/(δ0/kDf −1k)
ζ
, so that (8) is immediate when
df(x)(y1) ≥ δ0/kDf −1k:
kAf(x)(y1)k ≤ K1 ≤ C0(δ0/kDf −1
k)
ζ ≤ C0df(x)(y1)
ζ
.
Here kDf −1k is the supremum of all kDf −1
(z)k with z ∈ Uw, w ∈ V0, where
the norms are taken with respect to the Riemannian metrics in the local charts.
This permits us to restrict to the case when df(x)(y1) < δ0/kDf −1k in all that
follows. Let Γ1 be any curve on f(N)∩Uf(x)
joining f(x) to y1 and whose length
9
approximates df(x)(y1). Then Γ = f
−1
(Γ1) is a curve in N ∩ Ux joining x to
y = f
−1
(y1), with length less than δ0. In fact, cf. (12),
dx(y) ≤ length(Γ) ≤ (kDf −1
|E˜cu
f(x)k + ε0) length(Γ1).
This shows that dx(y) ≤ (kDf −1
|E˜cu

k + ε0)df(x)(y1).
Now we observe that
Af(x)(y1) =
∂us1(y) + ∂ss1(y) · Ax(y)

·

∂uu1(y) + ∂su1(y) · Ax(y)
−1
.
On the one hand, by (11) and (13),
k∂us1(y) + ∂ss1(y) · Ax(y)k ≤ K2dx(y) +

On the other hand, k∂su1(y) · Ax(y)k ≤ 0K1, which can be made much smaller
than 1/k(∂uu1(y)
−1k. As a consequence, recall (12) and (13),
k

∂uu1(y) + ∂ss1(y) · Ax(y)

k ≤ kDf −1
|E˜cu

where ε1 can be made arbitrarily small by reducing ε0. Putting these bounds
together, we conclude that kAf(x)(y1)k df(x)(y1)
−ζ
is less than
(kDf|E˜cs
x k + ε0)(kDf −1

.
So, choosing δ0, V0, a sufficiently small, we can make ε0, ε1, sufficiently close to
zero so that the factor multiplying κ(N) is less than some λ0 ∈ (λ1, 1); recall (9).
Moreover, the second term in the expression above is bounded by some constant
that depends only on f. We take C0 larger than this constant.
Remark 2.3. The proof remains valid if the diffeomorphism f is only of class
C
1+ζ
: it suffices to replace (13) by k∂su1(y)k, k∂us1(y)k ≤ K2dx(y)
ζ
, which is
sufficient for the rest of the argument.
Corollary 2.4. There exists C1 > 0 such that, given any C
1
submanifold N ⊂ V0
tangent to the centre-unstable cone field,
a) there exists n0 ≥ 1 such that κ(f
n
(N)) ≤ C1 for every n ≥ n0 such that
f
k
(N) ⊂ V0 for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n;
b) if κ(N) ≤ C1, then the same is true for every iterate f
n
(N), n ≥ 1, such
that f
k
(N) ⊂ V0 for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n;
10
c) in particular, if N and n are as in b), then the functions


|, 0 ≤ k ≤ n,
are (L1, ζ)-H¨older continuous with L1 > 0 depending only on C1 and f.
Proof. It suffices to choose any C1 ≥ C0/(1 − λ0).
Remark 2.5. Suppose that we have the following stronger form of domination
kDf|E
cs
x k · kDf −1
|E
cu
f(x)k
i ≤ λ for i = 1, 2,
and any x ∈ K. Then, assuming that f is a C
2 diffeomorphism, we may take ζ = 1
in the previous arguments. In that case, κ(N) yields a bound on the curvature
tensor of N. So, Corollary 2.4 asserts that if N is C
2
then the curvature of all
its iterates f
n
(N), n ≥ 1, is bounded by some constant that depends only on the
curvature of N.
2.2 Hyperbolic times and distortion bounds
The following notion will allow us to derive uniform behaviour (expansion, distortion) from the hypothesis of non-uniform expansion in (2).
Definition 2.6. Given σ < 1, we say that n is a σ-hyperbolic time for a point
x ∈ K if
Yn
j=n−k+1
kDf −1
| E
cu
f
j (x)
k ≤ σ
k
for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
In particular, if n is a σ-hyperbolic time for x then Df −k
| E
cu
fn(x)
is a contraction for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n:
kDf −k
| E
cu
fn(x)k ≤ Yn
j=n−k+1
kDf −1
| E
cu
f
j (x)
k ≤ σ
k
.
Moreover, if a is taken sufficiently small in the definition of our cone fields, and
we choose δ1 > 0 also small (in particular, the δ1-neighbourhood of K should be
contained in V0), then, by continuity,
kDf −1
(f(y))vk ≤ 1
√
σ
kDf −1
|E
cu
f(x)k kvk (14)
whenever x ∈ K, dist(x, y) ≤ δ1, and v ∈ C
cu(y).
Let D be any C
1 disk contained in V0 and tangent to the centre-unstable
cone field. We use distD(· , ·) to denote distance between two points in the disk,
measured along D. The distance from a point x ∈ D to the boundary of D is
distD(x, ∂D) = infy∈∂D distD(x, y).
11
Lemma 2.7. Given any C
1 disk D ⊂ V0 tangent to the centre-unstable cone
field, x ∈ D ∩ K, and n ≥ 1 a σ-hyperbolic time for x,
distfn−k(D)
(f

distfn(D)(f

for any point y ∈ D with dist(f

(y)) ≤ δ1.
Proof. Let η0 be a curve of minimal length in f
n
(D) connecting f
n
(x) to f
n
(y).
For 1 ≤ k ≤ n write ηk = f
n−k
(η0). We prove the lemma by induction. Let
1 ≤ k ≤ n and assume that
length(ηj ) ≤ δ1 for 0 ≤ j ≤ k − 1.
Denote by ˙η0(z) the tangent vector to the curve η0 at the point z. Then, in view
of the choice of δ1 in (14) and the definition of σ-hyperbolic times,
kDf −k
(z) ˙η0(z)k ≤ σ

kη˙0(z)k

As a consequence,
length(ηk) ≤ σ

length(η0) = σ
k/2
distfn−k(D)
(f
n−k
(y), fn−k
(x)) ≤ δ1 .
This completes our induction, thus proving the lemma.
Proposition 2.8. There exists C2 > 1 such that, given any C
1 disk D tangent
to the centre-unstable cone field with κ(D) ≤ C1, and given any x ∈ D ∩ K and
n ≥ 1 a σ-hyperbolic time for x, then
1
C2
≤
| det Dfn

| det Dfn | TxD|

for every y ∈ D such that dist(f

Proof. For 0 ≤ i < n and y ∈ D, we denote Ji(y) = | det Df | Tf
i(y)f
i
(D)|. Then,
log | det Dfn
| TyD|
| det Dfn | TxD|
=
Xn−1
i=0

log Ji(y) − log Ji(x)

By Corollary 2.4, log Ji
is (L1, ζ)-H¨older continuous, for some uniform L1 > 0.
Moreover, by Lemma 2.7, the sum of all distD(f
j
(x), fj
(y))ζ over 0 ≤ j ≤ n is
bounded by δ1/(1 − σ
ζ/2
). Now it suffices to take C2 = exp(L1δ1/(1 − σ
ζ/2
)).
12
2.3 Curvature at hyperbolic times
It is possible to obtain control of the curvature at hyperbolic times, without
having to assume the stronger form of domination in Remark 2.5. As before, we
assume that f is a C
2 diffeomorphism with a partially hyperbolic set K. Let
σ < 1 be fixed, and δ1 > 0 be chosen as in (14).
Proposition 2.9. Let D be a C
2 disk tangent to the centre-unstable cone field,
x ∈ D ∩ K, and n ≥ 1 be a σ-hyperbolic time for x. Then, the curvature of the
δ1-neighbourhood of f
n
(x) in f
n
(D) is bounded by a constant K0 > 0 that depends
only on f, σ, and the curvature of D. In fact, if n is sufficiently large then K0
may be taken depending only on f and σ.
The main idea in the proof of this proposition is to show that, up to conformal
changes of the Riemannian metric, we may suppose that Df | E
cu is uniformly
expanding at every point f
j
(x), 0 ≤ j < n. As a consequence, the domination
condition 2. in Subsection 1.1 implies the condition in Remark 2.5 (with respect
to the modified metrics). In doing this, it is important that all metric changes
can be done by dilation, which is due to the hyperbolic time condition.
Lemma 2.10. Let n ≥ 1 and a1, . . . , an, c0, be real numbers such that
Xn
j=k+1
aj ≥ (n − k)c0 for all 0 ≤ k < n. (15)
Then, there exist b1, . . . , bn such that
1. |bj
| ≤ sup1≤j≤n
|c0 − aj
| for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n;
2. aj + bj ≥ c0 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n;
3. Pk
j=1 bj ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ k < n and Pn
j=1 bj = 0.
Proof. Define bj by recurrence, through
b1 = max{0, c0 − a1} and bj = max{−X
j−1
i=1
bj
, c0 − aj} for j = 2, . . . , n.
The first condition in the statement is clear, in the case when bj = c0 − aj
.
Otherwise, bj = −
Pj−1
i=1 bi which, by construction, is always non-positive. So, in
this second case we must have 0 ≥ bj ≥ c0 − aj
, so that the bound in 1. remains
valid. The second condition follows immediately from the construction, and the
13
same is true for the first statement in 3. To obtain the last claim, we begin by
proving the following fact, by induction on j:
X
j
i=1
bi ≤
Xn
i=j+1
(ai − c0) for j = 1, . . . , n − 1. (16)
In view of (15),
Xn
i=2
(ai − c0) ≥ 0 and Xn
i=2
(ai − c0) ≥
Xn
i=1
(ai − c0) + (c0 − a1) ≥ (c0 − a1).
This gives Pn
i=2(ai − c0) ≥ max{0, c0 − a1} = b1, corresponding to case j = 1.
Now we suppose that, by recurrence, Pj−1
i=1 bi ≤
Pn
i=j
(ai − c0). Then, either
bj = c0 − aj
in which case, adding bj to both sides of the previous inequality
immediately gives the conclusion. Or else, bj = −
Pj−1
i=1 bi and then
X
j
i=1
bi = 0 ≤
Xn
i=j+1
(ai − c0),
due to our assumption (15). This completes the proof of (16). In particular,
taking j = n − 1, we get that −
Pn−1
i=1 bi ≥ c0 − an, and so bn = −
Pn−1
j=1 bi
.
Now we use this lemma to prove Proposition 2.9.
Proof. Let Dn be the neighbourhood of radius δ1 around f
n
(x) in f
n
(D), and
Dj = f
j−n
(Dn) for 0 ≤ j < n. Take c0 = − log σ and aj = − log kDf −1
|E
cu
f
j (x)
k,
1 ≤ j ≤ n, in Lemma 2.10. Let bj
, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, be the corresponding sequence,
and denote tj = exp(Pj
i=1 bi) for 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and t0 = 1. Conclusion 3. in the
lemma implies that
tj ≥ 1 for every j and tn = 1.
In all that follows k · kj denotes the metric obtained by multiplying the initial
Riemannian metric of M by tj
, 0 ≤ j ≤ n. Accordingly, we denote kDfkj−1,j
and kD2
fkj−1,j the norms of the derivatives of f from (M, k · kj−1) to (M, k · kj ).
We use similar notations for the restrictions of Df, Df −1
to the subbundles E˜cu
and E˜cs. Observe that
kDfkj−1,j = exp bjkDfk and kD
2
fkj−1,j =
exp bj
tj−1
kD
2
fk.
Since the bj are bounded, and the tj are larger than 1, kDfkj−1,j and kD2
fkj−1,j
are bounded by constants that depend only on f and σ. Note also that the
domination property is not affected by this conformal change of metrics:
kDf|E˜cs
y kj−1,j · kDf −1
|E˜cu
f(y)kj,j−1 = kDf|E˜cs
y k · kDf −1
|E˜cu
f(y)k ≤ λ, (17)
14
at every point y where these subbundles are defined.
Conclusion 2. in the lemma now means that
kDf −1
|E
cu
f
j (x)
kj,j−1 = exp(−bj − aj ) ≤ σ.
So, by (14) and Lemma 2.7, kDf −1
|E˜cu
f
j (y)
kj,j−1 ≤
√
σ < 1 for every y in D0 and
1 ≤ j ≤ n. Together with (17), this gives
kDf|E˜cs
f
j−1(y)
kj−1,j · kDf −1
|E˜cu
f
j (y)
k
2
j,j−1 ≤ λ
√
σ ≤ λ
for every y ∈ D0 and 1 ≤ j ≤ n. This means that a strong domination property
as in Remark 2.5 is valid, with respect to the relevant modified metrics, at every
point of D0 ∪ f(D0) ∪ · · · ∪ f
n−1
(D0). Since we already checked that the first
and second derivatives have uniformly bounded norms relative to these modified
metrics, the arguments in Proposition 2.2 carry on completely to the present
context to prove Proposition 2.9.
Closing this section we observe that these arguments could also be used to
give an alternative proof of the distortion bounds we obtained in the previous
section.
3 Lebesgue measure at hyperbolic times
The following lemma, due to Pliss [Pli72], will permit us to prove that a point
x satisfying assumption (2) has many (positive density at infinity) hyperbolic
times.
Lemma 3.1. Given A ≥ c2 > c1 > 0, let θ0 = (c2 − c1)/(A − c1). Then, given
any real numbers a1, . . . , aN such that
X
N
j=1
aj ≥ c2N and aj ≤ A for every 1 ≤ j ≤ N,
there are l > θ0N and 1 < n1 < · · · < nl ≤ N so that
Xni
j=n+1
aj ≥ c1(ni − n) for every 0 ≤ n < ni and i = 1, . . . , l.
Proof. (cf. [Ma˜n87, Section 2]) Define S(n) = Pn
j=1(aj −c1), for each 1 ≤ n ≤ N,
and also S(0) = 0. Then define 1 < n1 < · · · < nl ≤ N to be the maximal
15
sequence such that S(ni) ≥ S(n) for every 0 ≤ n < ni and i = 1, . . . , l. Note that
l can not be zero, since S(N) > S(0). Moreover, the definition means that
Xni
j=n+1
aj ≥ c1(ni − n) for 0 ≤ n < ni and i = 1, . . . , l.
So, we only have to check that l > θ0N. Observe that, by definition,
S(ni − 1) < S(ni−1) and so S(ni) < S(ni−1) + (A − c1)
for every 1 < i ≤ l. Moreover, S(n1) ≤ (A − c1) and S(nl) ≥ S(N) ≥ N(c2 − c1).
This gives,
N(c2 − c1) ≤ S(nl) = X
l
i=2

S(ni) − S(ni−1)

+ S(n1) < l(A − c1),
which completes the proof.
Clearly, the set H in the statement of Theorem A may be taken positively
invariant under f. Given any σ < 1, let H(σ) be the set of points in H for which
the limit in (2) is smaller than 3 log σ. Then H(σ) is positively invariant and,
since we are assuming that H has positive Lebesgue measure, H(σ) must also
have positive Lebesgue measure if σ is close enough to 1. Then, there exists some
small C
2 disk D transverse to the centre-stable subbundle, and intersecting H(σ)
in a set with positive Lebesgue measure inside D. Up to replacing it by some
small disk contained in f
l
(D) for some large enough l ≥ 1, we may suppose that
D is tangent to the centre-unstable cone field and κ(D) ≤ C1. Here κ(·) is the
H¨older constant defined by (10), recall Corollary 2.4. We fix such a disk D, once
and for all.
Corollary 3.2. There is θ > 0, depending only on σ and f, such that, given any
x ∈ D ∩ H(σ) and any sufficiently large N ≥ 1, there exist σ-hyperbolic times
1 ≤ n1 < · · · < nl ≤ N for x, with l ≥ θN.
Proof. Since x ∈ H(σ), we have
X

j=1
log kDf −1

k ≤ 2N log σ,
for all N ≥ 1 sufficiently large. Now it suffices to take c1 = | log σ|, c2 = 2c1,

16
Let δ1 > 0 be the small number introduced prior to Lemma 2.7. In particular,
we requested that the δ1-neighbourhood of the set K be contained in the domain
V0 of the invariant cone fields C
cs and C
cu. Reducing δ1 if necessary, we may
suppose that the subset A = A(D, σ, δ1) of points x ∈ D ∩ H(σ) such that
distD(x, ∂D) ≥ δ1 still has positive Lebesgue measure in D.
We consider the sequence
µn =
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
f
j
∗ LebD (18)
of averages of forward iterates of Lebesgue measure on D. A main idea is to
decompose µn as a sum of two measures, to be denoted νn and ηn, such that νn
is uniformly absolutely continuous on iterates of the disk D (uniformly bounded
density with respect to Lebesgue measure) and has total mass uniformly bounded
away from zero for all large n. This is done as follows.
Given integers n ≥ 1, define the following subset of D ∩ H(σ)
Hn = {x ∈ A : n is a σ-hyperbolic time for x}.
It follows from Lemma 2.7 that if x ∈ Hn then the distance from f
n
(x) to the
boundary of f
n
(D) is larger than δ1. For δ > 0, we denote ∆n(x, δ) the δneighbourhood of f
n
(x) inside f
n
(D). Clearly, (f
n
∗ LebD) | ∆n(x, δ1) is absolutely
continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on ∆n(x, δ1). Moreover, if x ∈ Hn
and one normalizes both measures, then Proposition 2.8 means that the density
of the former with respect to the latter is uniformly bounded from below and
above.
Proposition 3.3. There exists a constant τ > 0 such that for any n there exists
a finite subset Hbn of Hn such that the balls of radius δ1/4 in f
n
(D) around the
points x ∈ f
n
(Hbn) are two-by-two disjoint, and their union ∆n satisfies
f
n
∗ LebD(∆n ∩ H(σ)) ≥ f
n
∗ LebD(∆n ∩ f
n
(Hn)) ≥ τ LebD(Hn)
This is obtained taking N = f
n
(D) ∩ V0, ω = f
n
∗ LebD, r = δ1, Ω = f
n
(Hn),
and Hbn = I in the following abstract result.
Lemma 3.4. There exist τ > 0 and r0 > 0 such that the following holds. Let
N ⊂ V0 be a C
1
embedded submanifold of M tangent to the centre-unstable cone
field, and ω be a finite Borelian measure in N. Let 0 < r ≤ r0 and Ω ⊂ N be a
measurable subset with compact closure, whose distance to the boundary of N is
larger than r > 0.
Then there exists a finite subset I ⊂ Ω such that the balls ∆(x, r/4) in N
around the points of I are two-by-two disjoint, and their union ∆ satisfies
ω(∆ ∩ Ω) ≥ τω(Ω)
17
Proof. By the continuity of the centre-unstable cone field, we may fix r0 > 0 small
enough so that the connected component of the intersection of N with the ball
of radius r0 around each point z ∈ N that contains z coincides with the graph
of a map gz from a neighbourhood of 0 in E
cu
z
to E
cs
z
(or, to be more precise,
with the image of such a graph under the exponential map expz
). Moreover, as
long as r0 is small enough, then gz is a Lipschitz continuous map, with Lipschitz
constant depending only on the constant a in the definition of our cone fields. As
a consequence, there exists a constant R > 0 such that, given 0 < r1 < r2 ≤ r0,
any ball of radius r2 in N can be covered by at most (r2/r1)
dR balls of radius r1,
with d = dim E
cu. We assume that ω(Ω) > 0, since otherwise there is nothing to
prove.
Let 0 < r ≤ r0 and z1 ∈ N be such that ω(Ω ∩ ∆(z1, r)) is larger than
ω(Ω ∩ ∆(z, r))/2 for any other point z ∈ N. By the previous remarks, we may
find a point y1 ∈ N such that the ball ∆(y1, r/8) of radius r/8 around y1 intersects
∆(z1, r) and
ω(∆(y1, r/8) ∩ Ω) ≥
1
R8
d
ω(Ω ∩ ∆(z1, r)).
In particular ∆(y1, r/8) contains some point x1 ∈ Ω. We take it to be the first
point in our set I. Observe that, due to the choice of z1,
ω(∆(x1, r/4) ∩ Ω) ≥ ω(∆(y1, r/8) ∩ Ω)
≥
1
R8
d
ω(Ω ∩ ∆(z1, r))
≥
1
2R8
d
ω(Ω ∩ ∆(x1, r)). (19)
Now we consider Ω1 = Ω \ ∆(x1, r). Either this set has zero ω measure, in which
case we stop, or we may apply the same construction as before to determine a
second point x2 ∈ Ω. Observe that the balls of radius r/4 around x1 and x2 are
disjoint, since x2 belongs in Ω1. Repeating this procedure, we find a sequence
xi
, i ≥ 1, of points in Ω whose balls of radius r/4 are two-by-two disjoint. By
compactness, this sequence is necessarily finite. Moreover, by construction, Ω is
contained in the union of the balls of radius r around these xi
. So, using the
bound in (19),
ω(Ω) ≤ 2R8
dX
i
ω(∆(xi
, r/4)) ∩ Ω) = 2R8
dω(∆ ∩ Ω).
This means that we may take τ = 1/(2R8
d
).
18
In the sequel we shall denote Dn the family of balls of radius δ1/4 in f
n
(D)
around the points x ∈ f
n
(Hbn), that form ∆n. Now we define
νn =
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
(f
j
∗ LebD) | ∆j
, (20)
and ηn = µn − νn.
Proposition 3.5. There is α > 0 such that νn(H(σ)) ≥ α for all n large enough.
Proof. Recall that we took H and H(σ) positively invariant under f. By Proposition 3.3 we have that νn(H(σ)) is bounded from below by the product of τ by
n
−1 Pn−1
i=0 LebD(Hi). So, it suffices to prove that this last expression is larger than
some positive constant, for n large.
For all k > 0, denote Ak the set of points x ∈ A such that, for any n ≥ k
the sum Pn
j=1 log kDf −1
|E
cu
f
j (x)
k is smaller than 2n log σ. As A is the increasing
union of the An, there is k0 ≥ 1 such that the Lebesgue measure of Ak is nonzero
for all k ≥ k0 . Given any k ≥ k0, let ξn be the measure in {1, . . . , n} defined by
ξn(B) = #B/n, for each subset B. Then, using Fubini’s theorem

n
Xn−1

LebD(Hn) = Z Z
χ(x, i) d LebD(x)

dξn(i)
=
Z Z
χ(x, i) dξn(i)

d LebD(x),
where χ(x, i) = 1 if x ∈ Hi and χ(x, i) = 0 otherwise. Now, Corollary 3.2 means
that the integral with respect to dξn is larger than θ > 0, as long as k ≥ k0. So,
the expression on the right hand side is bounded from below by θ LebD(D).
Remark 3.6. We proved a slightly stronger fact, that will be useful in Section 4:
νn

∪
n−1
i=0 f
i
(D ∩ H(σ))
≥ α for every large n.
We consider some subsequence (nk)k such that µnk
and νnk
converge to measures µ and ν, respectively. It is easy to see that µ is a probability and f-invariant.
Moreover ν(K) ≥ lim supk νk(K) ≥ α > 0. We shall prove, in the next section,
that ν has a property of absolute continuity along certain (fairly large) disks
contained in its support. Here are some preparatory comments.
Recall that each νn is supported on a finite union ∪
n−1
j=0 ∆j of disks whose size
is bounded from below and from above. Then the support of ν is contained in
the set
∆∞ = ∩
∞
n=1 closure (∪j≥n∆j )
19
of accumulation points of such ∆j
. Given y ∈ ∆∞ then there exist (ji)i → ∞,
disks Di = ∆ji
(xi
, δ1/4) ⊂ ∆ji
, and points yi ∈ Di converging to y as i → ∞.
Up to considering subsequences, we may suppose that the centers xi converge
to some point x and, using the theorem of Ascoli-Arzela, the Di converge to a
disk D(x) of size δ1/4 around x. Then y is in the closure D¯(x) of D(x), and
D¯(x) ⊂ ∆∞.
We shall denote D∞ the family of disks D(x) obtained in this way. Observe
that these points x are in Hˆ∞ = ∩
∞
n=1 closure
∪j≥n f

(Hˆ


. Since every Hˆ
j
is contained in K, which is compact and positively invariant, Hˆ∞ is a subset of
∩
∞
n=1f
n
(K). According to the next lemma, D(x) depends only on x and not on
the various choices we made in the construction.
Lemma 3.7. The subspace E
cu
x
is uniformly expanding: kDf −k
| E
cu
x k ≤ σ
k/2
for all k ≥ 1. The disk D(x) is contained in the corresponding strong-unstable
manifold Wuu(x), and so it is uniquely defined by x. Moreover, D(x) is tangent
to the centre-unstable subbundle at every point of ∩
∞
n=1f
n
(K) ∩ D(x).
Proof. Let ji → ∞, xi → x, and Di → D(x) be as in the construction of D(x)
above. Note that Di
is contained in the ji-iterate of D, which was taken tangent
to the centre-unstable cone field. So, the domination property implies that the
angle between Di and E
cu goes to zero as i → ∞, uniformly on ∩
∞
n=1f
n
(K). By
Lemma 3.7, given any k ≥ 1 then f
−k
is a σ
k/2
-contraction on Di
for every large i.
Passing to the limit, we get that every f
k
is a σ
k/2
-contraction on D(x), and D(x)
is tangent to the centre-unstable subbundle at every point in ∩
∞
n=1f
n
(K) ∩ D(x),
including x.
In particular, we have shown that the subspace E
cu
x
is indeed uniformly expanding for Df. The domination property means that any expansion Df may
exhibit along the complementary direction E
cs is weaker than this. Then, see
[Pes76], there exists a unique strong-unstable manifold Wuu
loc (x) tangent to E
cu
and which is contracted by the negative iterates of f: for every y ∈ Wuu(x),
dist(f
−k
(x), f −k
(y)) decreases at least as kDf −k
| E
cu
x k ≤ σ
k/2 when k gets large.
To see that D(x) is contained in Wuu(x) is suffices to recall that it is contracted
by every f
−k
, and that all its negative iterates are tangent to centre-unstable
cone field.
4 Existence and finiteness of SRB measures
This section contains the proofs of Theorem A and Corollary B. First we show
that the measure ν obtained in the previous section has an absolute continuity
property on disks as in Lemma 3.7. Then, using the uniformly contracting bundle,
we conclude that some ergodic component of the invariant measure µ is an SRB
measure.
20
4.1 Absolute continuity
We write u = dim E
cu and s = dim E
cs, and use Bu
, Bs
to represent the unit
compact balls in the Euclidean space of dimension u, s, respectively. In what
follows we call cylinder any diffeomorphic image of Bu × Bs
.
Proposition 4.1. There exists a cylinder C ⊂ M, and there exists a family K∞
of disjoint disks contained in C ∩ ∆∞ and which are graphs over Bu
, such that
1. the union of all the disks in K∞ has positive ν-measure; in fact, the intersection of K with this union also has positive ν-measure;
2. the restriction of ν to that union has absolutely continuous conditional measures along the disks in K∞.
The first step of the proof is to construct a covering of the support of ν by
cylinders, one of which will be the C in the statement. Let us point out that these
cylinders we shall obtain are not small: each one contains some ball with radius
uniformly bounded away from zero, depending only on the diffeomorphism f.
As we have seen, given any y ∈ ∆∞ there exists a point x ∈ Hˆ∞ and a disk
D(x) of size δ1/4 around x such that y ∈ D¯(x) ⊂ ∆∞. For any such x and
r > 0 small, let Cr(x) be the tubular neighbourhood of D¯(x), defined as the
union of the images under the exponential map at each point z ∈ D¯(x) of all
vectors orthogonal to D¯(x) at z and with norm less or equal than r. We take
r to be sufficiently small, so that Cr(x) is a cylinder and it is endowed with a
canonical projection π : Cr(x) → D(x). Slightly adjusting r if necessary, we may
also suppose that the boundary of Cr(x) has zero ν-measure.
The covering of the support of ν by cylinders that we mentioned above will
be obtained decomposing each of these Cr(x) into a sufficient number of domains
with small diameter in the centre-unstable direction, as we now explain.
Recall that each set ∆j
, j ≥ 0, consists of a finite union of disks of radius
δ1/4 inside f
j
(D). For any small ε > 0, we denote ∆j,ε the subset of ∆j obtained
by removing the ε-neighbourhood of the boundary from each one of these disks.
Moreover, for n ≥ 1, we denote νn,ε the restriction of νn to ∪
n−1
j=0 ∆j,ε. Let α > 0
be as in Proposition 3.5.
Lemma 4.2. If ε > 0 is sufficiently small then νn,ε(K) ≥ α/2 for every large n.
Proof. This is a simple consequence of Proposition 3.5. Indeed, the proposition
implies that the νn-measure of K is greater or equal than α, for all large n. On
the other hand, if ε is small then the Lebesgue measure of the ε-neighbourhood
of the boundary of each disk in ∆j
is a small fraction of the Lebesgue measure
of that disk. Then, in view of the distortion bound given by Proposition 2.8, the
same is true with f
j
∗ LebD in the place of Lebesgue measure. So, taking ε small
21
enough, we are certain to have (f
j
∗ LebD)

∆j \∆j,ε
≤ α/2 for every j ≥ 0. Then,
by the definitions of νn and νn,ε,
νn(K) − νn,ε(K) ≤
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
(f
j
∗ LebD)

∆j \ ∆j,ε

2
.
This completes the proof.
In the sequel, we fix ε > 0 as in the lemma. Let x ∈ Hˆ∞ and π : Cr(x) → D¯(x)
be as above. We fix a covering of D¯(x) by finitely many domains Dx,l ⊂ D¯(x),
l = 1, . . . , N, small enough so that the intersection of each Cx,l = π
−1
(Dx,l) with
any smooth disk γ tangent to the centre-unstable cone has diameter less than ε
inside γ. We take the Dx,l diffeomorphic to the compact ball Bu
, so that every
Cx,l is a cylinder.
We say that a disk γ crosses Cx,l if π maps γ ∩ Cx,l diffeomorphically onto
Dx,l. For each j ≥ 0, let Kj (x, l) be the union of the intersections of Cx,l with all
the disks in Dj (the disks in the support ∆j of f
j
∗ LebD) that cross Cx,l. Similarly,
let K∞(x, l) be the union of the intersections of Cx,l with all the disks D(x) in
D∞ that cross Cx,l.
The next lemma asserts that, for at least one of the cylinders Cx,l, the part
of the measure ν that is carried by the disks in K∞(x, l) gives positive weight to
the set K. Recall that ν = lim νnk
for some (nk)k.
Lemma 4.3. There exist (x, l) and α1 > 0 such that ν

K ∩K∞(x, l)

≥ α1, and
νn

K ∩ ∪n−1
j=0 Kj (x, l)

≥ α1 for n in some subsequence of (nk)k.
Proof. For each n ≥ 1, let ˜νn,ε be the restriction of νn,ε to K, i.e., the measure
defined by ˜νn,ε(E) = νn,ε(K ∩ E) for every measurable subset E of M. Up to
replacing (nk)k by some subsequence, we may suppose that ˜νnk,ε converges to
some measure ˜νε. On the one hand, Lemma 4.2 means that ˜νn,ε(M) ≥ α/2 for
every large n, and so ˜νε(M) ≥ α/2. On the other hand, the support of ˜νε is
contained in ∩
∞
n=1 closure
∪j≥n ∆j,ε
, and this set is covered by the interiors of
the cylinders Cr(x). By compactness, the support of ˜νε is contained in the union
of a finite number of these Cr(x), and so it is also contained in the union of
finitely many cylinders Cx,l. As a consequence, there must be (x, l) such that
ν˜ε(Cx,l) > 0. We are going to show that any such (x, l) satisfies the conclusion of
the lemma, if α1 < ν˜ε(Cx,l).
Given any disk Dj
in Dj
, j ≥ 1, let Dj,ε be the subset obtained by removing
from Dj the ε-neighbourhood of the boundary. As a consequence of the way we
chose these cylinders, we have that if Dj,ε intersects Cx,l then Dj must cross Cx,l.
This implies that
ν˜n,ε
Cx,l
= νn,ε
K ∩ Cx,l
≤ νn

K ∩ ∪n−1
j=0 Kj (x, l)

22
for every n ≥ 1. Since the boundary of Cx,l has zero measure for ν, and ˜νε ≤ ν,
lim
k
ν˜nk,ε
Cx,l
= ˜νε(Cx,l) > α1 .
Combining this with the previous inequality, we get the second part of the lemma.
To get the first part, we observe that the accumulation set of ∪
n−1
j=0 Kj (x, l), as
n → ∞, is contained in K∞(x, l). So, since K is compact,
lim sup
k
νn

K ∩ ∪n−1
j=0 Kj (x, l)

≤ ν(K ∩ K∞(x, l)).
Thus, ν(K ∩ K∞(x, l)) ≥ ν˜ε(Cx,l) > α1 as we claimed.
In what follows, we fix (x, l) as in the lemma. We take the cylinder C in
Proposition 4.1 to be Cx,l, and we let K∞ be the family of disks forming K∞(x, l).
To complete the proof of the proposition, we now show that the restriction of ν to
K∞(x, l) has absolutely continuous conditional measures along the disks in K∞.
Lemma 4.4. There exists C3 > 1 and a family of conditional measures (νγ)γ of
ν | K∞(x, l) along the disks γ ∈ K∞, such that νγ is absolutely continuous with
respect to Lebesgue measure Lebγ on γ, with 1/C3 Lebγ(B) ≤ νγ(B) ≤ C3 Lebγ(B)
for any Borel set B ⊂ γ.
Proof. Let us introduce Kb(x, l) = ∪0≤j≤∞Kj (x, l)×{j}. In this space, we consider
the sequence of (finite) measures ˆνn defined by
νˆn (B0 × {0} ∪ · · · ∪ Bn−1 × {n − 1}) = 1
n
Xn−1
j=0
f
j
∗ LebD(Bj ),
and ˆνn(B) = 0 whenever B is contained in ∪n≤j≤∞Kj (x, l)×{j}. We also consider
a sequence of partitions Pk in Kb(x, l) constructed as follows. Fix an arbitrary
point z in Dx,l, and let V be the inverse image π
−1
(z) under the canonical projection. Fix also a sequence Vk, k ≥ 1, of increasing partitions of V with diameter
going to zero. Then, by definition, two points (x, m),(y, n) ∈ Kb(x, l) are in a
same atom of the partition Pk if
1. the disk in Dm containing x, and the disk in Dn containing y intersect a
same element of Vk;
2. either m ≥ k and n ≥ k or m = n < k.
It is clear from the construction that for any point ξ ∈ Kj (x, l), 0 ≤ j ≤ ∞,
P1(ξ) ⊃ · · · ⊃ Pk(ξ) ⊃ · · ·
23
and ∩
∞
k=1Pk(ξ) coincides with the intersection of the cylinder Cx,l with the disk
in Dj that contains ξ. Let ˆπ : Kb(x, l) → Dx,l be defined by ˆπ(x, j) = π(x). We
claim that there exits C3 > 1 such that, given any Borel subset B of Dx,l, k ≥ 1,
and ξ ∈ Kb(x, l),

C3
νn(Pk(ξ)) Leb(B) ≤ νˆn

πˆ


≤ C3νn(Pk(ξ)) Leb(B). (21)
Indeed, by definition each atom Pk(ξ) is a union of sets γ × {j}, where γ is the
intersection of the cylinder with a disk in Dj
. Since the projection π maps γ
diffeomorphically onto Dx,l,

for some uniform constant C4. By Proposition 2.8, the density of f

Since this holds for every γ, we get (21) with C3 = C

2C4/ Leb(Dx,l).
Clearly, any accumulation measure of the sequence ˆνn must be supported in
K∞(x, l) × {∞}. We have chosen a sequence nk such that νnk
converges to some
measure ν, and it is easy to see that this is just the same as saying that ˆνk
converges to the measure ˆν∞ defined by ˆν∞(B × {∞}) = ν(B), for any Borel set
B ⊂ Cx,l. Then, by (21) and the theorem of Radon-Nikodym, the disintegration
of ˆν along the disks ∩
∞
k=1Pk(ξ) is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue
measure on those disks, with densities almost everywhere bounded from above
by C3 and from below by 1/C3. Since ˆν is naturally identified with ν, this gives
the conclusion of the lemma.
At this point we completed the proof of Proposition 4.1.
4.2 Ergodicity and basin of attraction
Let us introduce some notations that are useful for the proof of the next lemma.
We denote by R the set of regular points z of f: this means that, given any
continuous function ϕ : M → R, both forward and backward time averages
lim n→+∞

ϕ(f

(z)) and lim n→+∞

Xn−1
j=0

24
exist and they coincide. The ergodic theorem ensures that R has full measure,
with respect to any invariant probability. We say that two points z, w ∈ R are
in a same accessibility class, see [BP74], [PS89], if there exist N ≥ 1 and points
z = z0, z1, . . . , zN−1, zN = w in R such that f
ti (zi) is in the union Ws
(zi−1) ∪
Wu
(zi−1) of the stable and the unstable sets of zi−1, for some integer ti and every
1 ≤ i ≤ N. It follows from the definition, that accessibility classes are invariant
sets. Since forward averages are constant on stable sets, and backward averages
are constant on unstable sets, the restriction of any invariant probability measure
to an accessibility class is an ergodic measure (possibly identically zero).
Lemma 4.5. The invariant measure µ = ν + η has some ergodic component
µ∗ whose Lyapunov exponents are all non-zero, and whose conditional measures
along local unstable manifolds are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue
measure. Moreover, we may choose µ∗ with support contained in ∩
∞
j=0f
j
(K) and
LebD(B(µ∗) ∩ H) > 0.
Proof. Since R has full µ-measure, it must also have full ν-measure. In particular,
up to replacing K∞ by a convenient sub-family of disks γ, whose union has full ν
measure in K∞, we may suppose that νγ almost every point in γ is regular, for
every γ ∈ K∞. In particular, Lebγ almost every point in any disk γ is regular.
Using the fact that the strong-stable foliation is absolutely continuous, cf. [BP74,
Section 2], we conclude that all such regular points are in a same accessibility
class. Moreover, this accessibility class A has positive ν-measure, and so also
positive µ-measure, by Lemma 4.3.
We let µ∗ be the normalized restriction of µ to A: µ∗(B) = µ(B∩A)/µ(A) for
every Borel set B. Then µ∗ is an invariant ergodic probability measure. It follows
from Lemma 3.7 that the Lyapunov exponents of µ∗ along the tangent space of
the disks γ are positive. Of course, the Lyapunov exponents along the strongstable direction are all negative. Since µ∗ is ergodic, its conditional measures
along local unstable manifolds in K∞ are either almost everywhere singular or
almost everywhere absolutely continuous (with respect to Lebesgue measure).
This is a well known fact, whose proof can be sketched as follows.
Suppose there is A ⊂ K∞(x, l) such that mγ(A ∩ γ) = 0 for all γ ∈ K∞, and
yet µ∗(A) > 0 (hence µ∗γ(A ∩ γ) > 0 for many γ ∈ K∞). Let B = ∪
+∞
j=−∞f
j
(A).
By ergodicity, µ∗(B) = 1, and so µ∗,γ(B ∩ γ) = 1 for ˆµ∗-almost all γ in K∞.
On the other hand, mγ(B ∩ γ) = 0 for every γ ∈ K∞. This is because f is a
diffeomorphism, unstable manifolds are an invariant family of submanifolds, and
B is given by a countable union. So, in this case, µ∗γ is singular with respect to mγ
for ˆµ∗-almost all γ ∈ K∞. Now suppose that, on the contrary, every measurable
set A ⊂ K∞(x, l) satisfying mγ(A ∩ γ) = 0 for all γ ∈ K∞ has zero µ∗-measure.
Then, restricted to K∞(x, l), µ∗ is absolutely continuous with respect to the
product measure mγ × µˆ∗ . Consequently, in this second case, the conditional
25
measures µ∗,γ are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure mγ for
µˆ∗-almost every γ in K∞.
In the setting we are dealing with, the singular case is easily excluded: the
conditional measures of µ∗ can be written as the sum of the conditional measures
of the restrictions of η and ν to the accessibility class, and the latter are equivalent
to Lebesgue measure at least on K∞(x, l). So, the conditional measures of µ∗ must
be almost everywhere absolutely continuous.
Since ν(K ∩ K∞(x, l)) is positive, by Lemma 4.3, µ(K ∩ A) > 0 and so
µ∗(K) > 0. As K is compact and positively invariant, the ergodicity of µ∗ implies
that µ∗(∩
∞
n=0f
n
(K)) = 1, and the support of µ∗ is contained in ∩
∞
j=0f
j
(K).
To prove the last statement in the lemma we need the following fact:
Claim: There exists a disk D∞ inside K∞(x, l) such that Lebesgue almost all
the points in D∞ are in the basin of µ∗, and there exists a sequence Dk of disks
in Kjk
(x, l) accumulating on D∞ and such that LebDk
(Dk ∩ f
jk (H(σ) ∩ D)) is
uniformly bounded away from zero.
We assume this for a while, and explain how to conclude the proof of the
lemma from it. Since forward averages of continuous functions are constant on
strong-stable leaves, the basin of µ∗ contains the union of all strong-stable leaves
through Lebesgue almost all points in D∞. As this foliation is absolutely continuous, and the Dk accumulate on D∞, such union intersects Dk in a subset whose
relative Lebesgue measure inside Dk goes to 1 when k goes to infinity. In particular, LebDk
(Dk ∩ f
jk (H(σ) ∩ D) ∩ B(µ∗)) is positive for every large k. Of course,
the basin is invariant by f, so we may conclude that LebD(H(σ)∩B(µ∗)) > 0.
All that is left to do is to prove the Claim above.
Proof. We use Remark 3.6:
νn

∪
n−1
i=0 f
i
(D ∩ H(σ))
≥ α.
It follows that if  > 0 is fixed sufficiently small then there exists a subset of disks
in the support of νn with total νn-mass larger than α/2 and such that a fraction
larger than  of any such disk corresponds to points coming from D∩H(σ). Then,
by the same argument as at the end of the proof of Lemma 4.3, the union E of
the disks in D∞ that are accumulated by disks as above has ν-mass larger than
α/2. Then some of these disks must be such that Lebesgue almost all points in it
are in the basin of µ∗. Indeed, since µ∗ is ergodic, its basin has full µ∗-measure.
Then, a full measure subset of E consists of disks where almost all points, with
respect to the conditional measure of µ∗ on the disk, are in B(µ∗). Since we know
that the conditional measures of µ∗ along the disks in K∞ are bounded away from
zero (because the same is true for ν, cf. Lemma 4.4), we conclude that Lebesgue
almost all points in some disk in E is in B(µ∗).
26
As a consequence, we also get that

y k dµ∗(y) < 2 log σ (22)
for µ∗-almost every x ∈ M (and for every x ∈ B(µ∗) that remains in the neighbourhood V0 where E
cu has a meaning). This is a simple consequence of the
ergodicity of µ∗, and the fact that its basin intersects H(σ). In particular, all
the Lyapunov exponents of µ∗ in the centre-unstable direction are larger than
− log σ.
Finally, we deduce the following result which completes the proof of Theorem A and also gives Corollary B.
Corollary 4.6. For any σ < 1, a full Lebesgue measure subset of H(σ) is contained in the union of finitely many SRB measures supported in ∩
∞
j=0f
j
(K).
Proof. First we observe that the set of points in H(σ) which do not belong in
the basin of some SRB measure as in the statement must have zero Lebesgue
measure. Indeed, otherwise we could apply the previous arguments with this set
in the place of H(σ): we would get, cf. Lemma 4.5, an extra positive Lebesgue
measure subset in the basin of some SRB measure, contradicting the definition.
The main point to obtain the finiteness statement is to note that the choice
of δ1 in the context of (14) depends only on σ. Using this remark, we can deduce
that for any SRB measure µ∗ as we constructed above there exists a disk D(µ∗) of
fixed radius δ1, tangent to the centre-unstable cone field and such that Lebesgue
almost every point in D(µ∗) is in the basin of µ∗. For this, we recall that for the
SRB measures we constructed above there exist disks D0 containing some point
x ∈ H(σ) ∩ B(µ∗) and on which Lebesgue almost every point is in the basin
B(µ∗). In view of (22), x has many σ-hyperbolic times n. We may take D(µ∗) to
be the disk of radius δ1 around f
n
(x) inside f
n
(D0), for any such n sufficiently
large.
Then, the union of all strong-stable leaves through the points in D(µ∗)∩B(µ∗)
is contained in B(µ∗). Using the absolute continuity property of the strong-stable
foliation, we may conclude that this union contains a subset of a neighbourhood of
D(µ∗) with volume bounded away from zero by some constant that depends only
on δ1 and f. For this, we fix some neighbourhood of D(µ∗) with size uniformly
bounded from below, as well as a smooth foliation of it by disks C
1
close to D(µ∗).
For instance, D(µ∗) could be contained in one of the leaves of this foliation. Given
any leaf D, the strong-stable manifolds through the points of D(µ∗) intersect D
on a subdisk D0 whose Lebesgue measure inside D is bounded away from zero,
by a constant that depends only on the size δ1 of D, and on the map f. This
is just by continuity of the strong-stable foliation. Moreover, absolute continuity
27
implies that Lebesgue almost every point of D0
is in the strong-stable manifold of
a point of D(µ∗)∩B(µ∗). Now, our claim that the Lebesgue measure of the union
of these strong-unstable leaves is uniformly bounded away from zero follows from
Fubini’s theorem.
Of course, basins of different SRB measures are two-by-two disjoint. So the
conclusion of the previous paragraph implies that there can only be finitely many
such measures (even if we do not assume M to be compact), since small neighbourhoods of the compact set K have finite volume.
5 Maps with singular or critical points
Here we explain how the previous arguments can be adapted to prove Theorem C
and Corollary D. A main difference concerns the notion of hyperbolic times.
A key point in the previous sections was that if n is a hyperbolic time for a
point x then there exists a neighbourhood of x, in the disk D, which is mapped
onto a ball of fixed radius around f
n
(x), in f
n
(D), diffeomorphically and with
uniformly bounded distortion. This was a consequence of the contraction property
in Definition 2.6. Now, in the presence of a singular set S, in order to have a
similar property we must also ensure that iterates f
j
(x) with 0 ≤ j < n are not
too close to S.
Let B > 1 and β > 0 be as in the hypotheses (S1), (S2), (S3). In what follows
b is any fixed constant such that 0 < b < min{1/2, 1/(2β)}.
Definition 5.1. Given σ < 1 and δ > 0, we say that n is a (σ, δ)-hyperbolic time
for a point x ∈ M \ S∞ if, for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n,
nY−1
j=n−k
kDf(f
j
(x))−1
k ≤ σ
k
and distδ(f
n−k
(x), S) ≥ σ
bk
.
Let us begin by proving that this notion does imply the key property above:
Lemma 5.2. Given σ < 1 and δ > 0, there exists δ1 > 0 such that if n is a
(σ, δ)-hyperbolic time for a point x ∈ M \ S∞, then there exists a neighbourhood
Vx of x such that
1. f
n maps Vx diffeomorphically onto the ball of radius δ1 around f
n
(x);
2. for every 1 ≤ k < n and y, z ∈ Vx,
dist(f
n−k
(y), fn−k
(z)) ≤ σ
k/2
dist(f
n
(y), fn
(z)).
28
Proof. We shall prove, by induction on j ≥ 1, that if δ1 is chosen small enough
then there exists a well defined branch of f
−j on the ball of radius δ1 around
f
n
(x), mapping f
n
(x) to f
n−j
(x). In addition, this branch is a σ
j/2
-contraction.
The precise condition δ1 should satisfy is given by the following statement:
Claim: Fix δ1 > 0 so that 4δ1 < δ and 4Bδ1 < δβ
| log σ|. Then,
kDf(y)

dist(f

In either case, dist(y, fn−j

Since δ and σ are smaller than 1, and we took bβ < 1/2, the term on the right
hand side is bounded by 2Bδ1δ
−β
. Moreover, our second condition on δ1 means
that this last expression is smaller than log σ
−1/2
.
Starting the induction argument to prove Lemma 5.2, we note that for j = 1
the Claim gives
kDf(y)
−1
k ≤ σ
−1/2
kDf(f
n−1
(x))−1
k ≤ σ

,
since n is a hyperbolic time for x. This means that f is a σ
−1/2
-dilation in
the ball of radius 2δ1σ
1/2 around f
n−1
(x). As a consequence, there exists some
neighbourhood V (n − 1) of f
n−1
(x) contained in that ball of radius 2δ1σ
1/2
, that
is mapped diffeomorphically onto the ball of radius δ1 around f
n
(x).
Now, given any j > 1, let us suppose that we have constructed a neighbourhood V (n − j + 1) of f
n−j+1(x) such that the restriction of f
j−1
to V (n − j + 1)
is a diffeomorphism onto the ball of radius δ1 around f
n
(x), with
kDf(f

k ≤ σ
−1/2
kDf(f
n−j+i+1(x))−1
k (24)
for all z in V (n − j + 1) and 0 ≤ i < j. Then, by the Claim and the hypothesis
that n is a hyperbolic time for x,

k ≤ σ

29
for any point y in the ball of radius 2δ1σ
j/2 whose image z = f(y) is in V (n−j+1).
Now we can construct an inverse branch of f
j on the ball of radius δ1 around
f
n
(x), by lifting geodesics in the following way. Given a geodesic γ connecting f
n
(x) to a point in the boundary of the ball, there is a well defined lift of
the restriction of γ to a small neighbourhood of f
n
(x), into a curve starting at
f
n−j
(x). Moreover, as far as this curve does not leave the ball of radius 2δ1σ
j/2
,
the derivative on it is a σ
−j/2
-dilation. This means that the length of the lifted
curve is less than δ1σ
j/2
, and so the curve is actually contained in a smaller ball.
This proves that the lift is well defined on the whole geodesic γ. Thus, we have
a well defined branch of f
−j on the ball of radius δ1 around f
n
(x) as we claimed.
We call V (n − j) the image of that inverse branch. By construction, V (n − j)
is contained in the 2δ1σ
j/2
-ball around f
n−j
(x) and its image under f coincides
with V (n − j + 1). So, in view of the Claim, we also recovered the induction
assumption (24) for points in V (n − j) and times 0 ≤ i ≤ j.
In this way, we construct neighbourhoods V (n − j) of f
n−j
(x) as above, for
all 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The lemma follows taking Vx = V (0).
Corollary 5.3. There exists C5 > 0 such that for every x ∈ M \ S∞, any n that
is a (σ, δ)-hyperbolic time for x, and every y, z ∈ Vx

C5

f
k
(z) is less than δ1σ
(n−k)/2
, which is much smaller than σ

So, assumption (S3) implies

, recall that bβ < 1/2.
Let σ < 1 be fixed. The assumptions of Theorem C imply that, if σ is close
enough to 1, then the set H(σ) of points x ∈ M \ S∞ for which the limit in (5)
is less than 3 log σ has positive Lebesgue measure. The next lemma asserts that
points in H(σ) have many (σ, δ)-hyperbolic times.
Lemma 5.4. There are θ > 0 and δ > 0, depending only on σ and on the map
f, such that given any x ∈ H(σ) and any sufficiently large N ≥ 1 there exist
(σ, δ)-hyperbolic times 1 ≤ n1 < · · · < nl ≤ N for x, with l ≥ θN.
Proof. The strategy is to use Lemma 3.1 twice, first for the sequence given by
aj = − log kDf(f
j−1
(x))−1k (up to a cut off that makes it bounded from above),
30
and then with aj = log distδ(f
j−1
(x), S) for a convenient δ > 0. We prove that
there exist many times ni
for which the conclusion of Pliss’ Lemma 3.1 holds,
simultaneously, for both sequences. Then we check that any such ni
is a (σ, δ)-
hyperbolic time for x.
Let x ∈ H(σ). By definition of H(σ), for every large N we have
N
X−1
j=0
− log kDf(f
j

k ≥ 2| log σ|N .
Fix any ρ > β. Then (S1) implies that


log kDf(x)
−1
k

 ≤ ρ | log dist(x, S)| (25)
for every x in a neighbourhood V of S. Fix ε1 > 0 so that ρε1 ≤ | log σ|/2, and
let r1 > 0 be small enough so that
N
X−1
j=0
− log distr1
(f
j
(x), S) ≤ ε1N . (26)
Assumption (6) ensures that this is possible. Fix any H1 ≥ ρ | log r1| large enough
so that it is also an upper bound for − log kDf −1k on the complement of V . Then
let E be the subset of times 1 ≤ j ≤ N such that − log kDf(f
j−1
(x))−1k > H1,
and define
aj =

− log kDf(f
j−1
(x))−1k if j /∈ E
0 if j ∈ E.
By construction, aj ≤ H1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ N. Note that if j ∈ E then f
j−1
(x) ∈ V .
Moreover, for j ∈ E we have dist(f
j−1
(x), S) < r1:
ρ | log r1| ≤ H1 < − log kDf(f
j−1
(x))−1
k < ρ | log dist(f
j−1
(x), S)|.
In particular, distr1
(f
j−1
(x), S) = dist(f
j−1
(x), S) < r1 for all j ∈ E. Therefore,
by (25) and (26),
X
j∈E
− log kDf(f

k ≤ ρ

j∈E
| log dist(f

We have chosen ε1 in such a way that the last term is less than | log σ|N/2. As a

31
Thus, we have checked that we may apply Lemma 3.1 to aj
, with c1 = | log σ|,
c2 = 3 | log σ|/2, and A = H1. The lemma provides θ1 > 0 and l1 ≥ θ1N times
1 ≤ p1 < · · · < pl1 ≤ N such that

for every 0 ≤ n < pi and 1 ≤ i ≤ l1.
Now fix ε2 > 0 small enough so that ε2/(b| log σ|) < θ1, and let r2 > 0 be such
that, cf. condition (6),
N
X−1
j=0
log distr2
(f

Let c1 = b log σ, c2 = −ε2, A = 0, and
θ2 =

ε2
b | log σ|
.
Applying Lemma 3.1 to the sequence aj = log distr2
(f
j−1
(x), S), we conclude
that there are l2 ≥ θ2N times 1 ≤ q1 < · · · < ql2 ≤ N such that
q
Xi−1
j=n
log distr2
(f
j
(x), S) ≥ b log σ (qi − n) (28)
for every 0 ≤ n < qi and 1 ≤ i ≤ l2 .
Finally, our condition on ε2 means that θ1 +θ2 > 1. Let θ = θ1 +θ2 −1. Then
there exist l = (l1 + l2 − N) ≥ θN times 1 ≤ n1 < · · · < nl ≤ N at which (27)
and (28) occur simultaneously:
nXi−1

log kDf(f

k ≤ (ni − n) log σ
and
nXi−1
j=n
log distr2

for every 0 ≤ n < ni and 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Therefore, given 1 ≤ i ≤ l and 1 ≤ k ≤ ni

Yni

kDf −1
(f

and distr2

In other words, all those ni are (σ, δ)-hyperbolic times for x, for δ = r2.
32
Now we prove Theorem C, the same argument gives Corollary D.
Proof. Let H be the positive Lebesgue measure set in the statement, and H(σ)
be as above.
Lemma 5.5. Suppose σ is close enough to 1 so that H(σ) has positive Lebesgue
measure. Then f admits some invariant probability measure µ0 absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure and giving positive weight to H(σ).
Proof. According to Lemma 5.4, there exists δ > 0 depending only on σ, such
that for any point x in H(σ) there exist many (σ, δ)-hyperbolic times. We let
µn be the averages of the positive iterates of Lebesgue measure on M, and νn be
part of µn carried on disks of radius δ1 around points f
j
(x) such that 1 ≤ j ≤ n
is a (σ, δ)-hyperbolic time for x. More precisely, arguing as in Lemma 3.4 and
Proposition 3.3, we may find for each j ≥ 1 a finite set of points x1, . . . , xN
admitting j as a (σ, δ)-hyperbolic time, such that
1. Vx1
, . . . , VxN
are two-by-two disjoint;
2. the Lebesgue measure of Wj = Vx1 ∪ . . . ∪ VxN
is larger than the Lebesgue
measure of the set of points in H(σ) having j as a (σ, δ)-hyperbolic time,
up to a uniform multiplicative constant τ > 0.
Then we take
νn =
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
f
j
∗
(Leb |Wj ).
As before in Proposition 3.5, each of these νn has total mass bounded away from
zero, in fact, νn(H(σ)) ≥ α for some uniform α > 0. Moreover, as a consequence
of the distortion Corollary 5.3, every f
j
∗
(Leb |Wj ) is absolutely continuous with
respect to Lebesgue measure, with density uniformly bounded from above, and
so the same is true for every νn.
Now take nk → ∞ such that both µnk
and νnk
converge to measures µ and
ν, respectively, in the weak∗
sense. Then µ is an invariant probability measure,
µ = ν+η for some measure η, ν is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue
measure, and ν(H(σ)) ≥ α > 0. Now, if η = ηac + ηs denotes the Lebesgue
decomposition of η (as the sum of an absolutely continuous and a completely
singular measure, with respect to Lebesgue measure), then µac = ν + ηac gives
the absolutely continuous component in the corresponding decomposition of µ.
By uniqueness of the Lebesgue decomposition, and the fact that the push-forward
under f preserves the class of absolutely continuous measures, we may conclude
that µac is an invariant measure. Clearly, µac(H(σ)) ≥ ν(H(σ)) > 0.
33
Up to replacing µ0 by its normalized restriction to the (positively invariant)
set H(σ) we may suppose that µ0(H(σ)) = 1. The next lemma will allow us
to show that H(σ) is covered by the basins of finitely many ergodic absolutely
continuous invariant measures.
Lemma 5.6. For any positively invariant set G ⊂ H(σ) there exists some disk
∆ with radius δ1/4 such that Leb(∆ \ G) = 0.
Proof. It suffices to prove that there exist disks of radius δ1/4 where the relative
measure of G is arbitrarily close to 1.
Let  be some small number, Gc be a compact subset of G, and Go be a
neighbourhood of Gc such that both G \ Gc and Go \ Gc have Lebesgue measure
less than  Leb(G). By Lemma 5.4 and Fubini’s theorem, there exist arbitrarily
large values of j ≥ 1 such that the Lebesgue measure of the subset Gj of points
in G for which j is a (σ, δ)-hyperbolic time has Lebesgue measure is at least
θ Leb(G). So, as long as  is fixed sufficiently small, the Lebesgue measure of
Gc ∩ Gj
is larger than (θ/2) Leb(G). Assume that j is large enough so that for
any point x in Gc ∩ Gj
, the neighbourhood Vx is contained in Go. Here Vx is the
neighbourhood of x constructed in Lemma 5.2: it is mapped diffeomorphically
onto the ball of radius δ1 around f
j
(x) by f
j
. Let Wx ⊂ Vx be the pre-image
of the ball of radius δ1/4 under this diffeomorphism. Let x1, . . . , xN ∈ Gc ∩ Gj
be such that Wx1
, . . . , WxN
cover the compact set Gc ∩ Gj
. Up to reordering,
we may suppose that Wx1
, . . . , Wxn
, some n ≤ N, is a maximal sub-family whose
elements are two-by-two disjoint. Notice that the Vx1
, . . . , Vxn
cover Gc∩Gj
, since
their union contains every Wxi
, 1 ≤ i ≤ N. Indeed, every Wxi must intersect
some Wxk with k ≤ n. Then its image under f
j
intersects the ball of radius δ1/4
around f
j
(xk) and so it is contained in the corresponding ball of radius δ1. This
means, precisely, that Wxi
is contained in Vxk
.
By the bounded distortion property, Leb(Wx) is larger than the product of
Leb(Vx) by some uniform constant τ > 0 (independent of x or j). So, the Lebesgue
measure of Wx1 ∪ · · · ∪ Wxn
is larger than τ Leb(Gc ∩ Gj ). If ξ > 0 is such that
Leb(Wxi
\ (Gc ∩ Gj )) ≥ ξ Leb(Wxi
) for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, then
Leb
Wx1 ∪ · · · ∪ Wxn
) \ (Gc ∩ Gj )

≥ ξτ Leb(Gc ∩ Gj ) ≥ ξτθ Leb(G)
On the other hand, since the Wxi
are contained in Go and Gc ∩ Gj ⊂ G, this
measure must be smaller than  Leb(G). This means that by reducing  (which
we may, by increasing j), we can force ξ to be arbitrarily small. In other words,
we may find j and Wxi
such that the relative Lebesgue measure of Wxi∩Gc∩Gj
in
Wxi
is arbitrarily close to 1. Then, by bounded distortion, the relative Lebesgue
measure of G ⊃ f
j
(Gc ∩ Gj ) in the ball of radius δ1/4 around f
j
(xi) is also
arbitrarily close to 1. So the proof of the lemma is complete.
34
Finally, we may conclude the proof of Theorem C and Corollary D.
Let µ0 be any absolutely continuous invariant measure with µ0(H(σ)) = 1. If
µ0 is not ergodic then we may decompose H(σ) into two disjoint invariant sets
H1, H2 both with positive µ0-measure. In particular, both H1 and H2 have positive Lebesgue measure. Let µ1, µ2 be the normalized restrictions of µ0 to H1, H2,
respectively. Clearly, they are also absolutely continuous invariant measures. If
they are not ergodic, we continue decomposing them, in the same way as we did
for µ0. On the other hand, by Lemma 5.6, each one of the invariant sets we find
in this decomposition has full Lebesgue measure in some disk with fixed radius.
Since these disks must be disjoint, and the ambient manifold is compact, there
can only be finitely many of them. So, the decomposition must stop after a finite number of steps, giving that µ0 can be written µ0 =
Ps
i=1 µ0(Hi)µi where
H1, . . . , Hs is a partition of H(σ) into invariant sets with positive measure and
each µi(·) = µ0(· ∩ Hi)/µ0(Hi) is an ergodic measure.
This completes the proof of Theorem C and Corollary D, and it also gives the
finiteness result stated in Subsection 1.1 right after the corollary.
Having in mind important classes of maps with singularities, such as Poincar´e
return maps of singular (or generalized Lorenz) attractors, [ABS77], [GW79],
[Rov93], [MPP98], [BPV97] we now propose a natural extension of the previous
results for partially hyperbolic maps with singularities.
Let us a manifold M, a compact subset S, and a C
2 diffeomorphism (onto its
image) f : M \ S → M. We suppose f has a compact positively invariant subset
K, in the sense that f(K \ S) ⊂ K, such that the tangent bundle of M restricted
to K \ S has a Df-invariant dominated splitting TK\SM = E
ss ⊕ E
cu such that
E
ss is uniformly contracting.
We assume that f behaves like a power of the distance to S along the centreunstable direction: for every x ∈ K \ S and v ∈ E

x and y are in a same disk tangent to the centre-unstable cone field, and
distcu(x, y) < distcu(x, S)/2.
Here distcu denotes the shortest distance measured along curves tangent to the
centre-unstable cone field, and we also define the truncated version distcu
δ
of distcu
,
in the same way as in (4). Let S∞ = ∪
+∞
n=−∞f
n
(S).
35
Although we did not try to check all the details, it seems that the following
statement can be obtained by combining the arguments in the proofs of Theorems A and C:
Let f be as above, and assume that it is non-uniformly expanding along the
centre-unstable direction, in the sense that (2) holds for all x in a positive Lebesgue
measure set H ⊂ M \ S∞ Assume moreover that, given any ε > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that for every x ∈ H

Then Lebesgue almost every point in H is in the basin of some SRB measure.
The main technical point in giving a full proof, is to control the curvature of
iterates of disks tangent to the centre-unstable cone field, similarly to what we
did in Subsection 2.1.
6 Diffeomorphisms with a dominated splitting
Let f : M → M be a C
1+ζ diffeomorphism on a manifold M. Here we suppose
that f has a compact positively invariant set K ⊂ M with a continuous invariant
dominated splitting TKM = E
cs ⊕ E
cu: there exists a constant λ < 1 and some
choice of a Riemannian metric on M such that
• kDf | E
cs
x k · kDf −1
| E
cu
f(x)
k ≤ λ for all x ∈ K.
We call E
cs centre-stable subbundle and E
cu centre-unstable subbundle.
As we did at the beginning of Section 2, we can extend the subbundles continuously to a neighbourhood V0 of K, and then consider cone fields C
cs
a
and C
cu
a
with small width a > 0 around these extended subbundles. As before, we assume
that f is non-uniformly expanding along the centre-unstable direction:
lim sup

for every x in a positive Lebesgue measure subset H of D ∩ K, where D is some
C
2 disk tangent to the centre-unstable cone field. We fix any σ < 1 such that
H(σ), defined as in Section 3, has positive Lebesgue measure in D.
Everything we did in Section 2 through Subsection 4.1 applies immediately
in this context. So, cf. Proposition 4.1, there exist measures µ, ν, η, a cylinder C
and a family K∞ of disjoint disks crossing C such that
36
1. µ is an invariant probability measure and µ = ν + η;
2. the disks in K∞ are accumulated by sub-disks of radius δ1 in f
n
(D), around
points f
n
(x) such that n is a σ-hyperbolic time for x ∈ H(σ);
3. the union K∞ of all the disks in K∞ intersects K in a set with positive
ν-measure;
4. the restriction of ν to K∞ has absolutely continuous conditional measures
along the disks in K∞.
Let us recall a few well-known notions and facts that are useful for the proof
of the next lemma. Given a point x, let us denote µx the probability measure
given by the time average along the orbit of x:
Z
ϕ dµx = lim n→+∞
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
ϕ(f
j
(x)) for every continuous ϕ : M → R. (30)
According to the ergodic decomposition theorem, see [Ma˜n87, Section 2.6], µx is
well-defined and ergodic for every x in a set Σ ⊂ M that has full measure with
respect to any invariant measure ξ. Moreover, x 7→
R
g dµx is measurable and
Z
g dξ =
Z Z
g dµx

dξ(x)
for every measurable bounded function g : M → R. In fact, for any such g the
integral R
g dµx coincides almost everywhere with the time average of g over the
orbit of x.
Let R be the set of regular points of f, as introduced in Subsection 4.2:
z ∈ R if and only if the forward and backward time averages of each continuous
function over the orbit of z exist and coincide. R has full measure for any finvariant probability measure ξ, as a consequence of Birkhoff’s ergodic theorem.
Let us point out that µx is constant on the intersection of R with every disk γ
of K∞. This is because these disks are (exponentially) contracted by negative
iterates, cf. property 2. above and Lemmas 2.7 and 3.7, and so points in a same
γ ∈ K∞ have the same backward average (hence points in R ∩ γ also have the
same forward average) for each continuous function ϕ.
Lemma 6.1. There exists z ∈ K∞ ∩ K ∩ Σ ∩ R such that µz(K∞ ∩ K) > 0
and µz has absolutely continuous conditional measures along the disks in K∞. In
particular, the support of µz is contained in ∩
∞
j=0f
j
(K).

Proof. Fix B to be some measurable subset of M such that
mγ(B ∩ γ) = 0 for every γ ∈ K∞, (31)
and µ(B) is maximal among all measurable sets with this property. For instance,
B = ∪nBn where the Bn, n ≥ 1, are measurable sets with property (31) such
that µ(Bn) converges to the largest value compatible with that property. Observe
that ν(B) = 0, because ν is absolutely continuous along the leaves of K∞. Let
Z∞ = K∞ ∩ K ∩ Σ ∩ R \ B. Then,
µ(Z∞) ≥ ν(Z∞) = ν(K∞ ∩ K ∩ Σ ∩ R) = ν(K∞ ∩ K) > 0.
Let (µ | Z∞) be the restriction of µ to Z∞: by definition (µ | Z∞)(E) = µ(E∩Z∞)
for any measurable set E in M.
Let A be any measurable subset of Z∞ such that mγ(A ∩ γ) = 0 for every
γ ∈ K∞. Then µ(A) must be zero, since we took µ(B) maximal. This means that
(µ | Z∞) is absolutely continuous with respect to the product mγ × µˆ, where ˆµ
stands for the quotient measure induced by (µ | Z∞) on K∞. As a consequence,
the conditional measures ˜µγ of (µ | Z∞) on the disks γ ∈ K∞ are absolutely
continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure mγ for ˆµ-almost all γ ∈ K∞. On
the other hand, for any measurable set A ⊂ Z∞ ,
µ(A) = Z
µx(A) dµ(x) (32)
where the integral is taken over M or, more precisely, over the full measure subset
Σ. We want to express this in terms of an integral over Z∞. As we mentioned
before,
µx(A) = Z
XA dµx = lim n→+∞
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
XA(f
j
(x))
almost everywhere, with respect to any invariant measure. So, up to disregarding
a zero µ-measure set of points, µx(A) can be non-zero only if x has some iterate in
A ⊂ Z∞ . Let k(z) denote the first backward return time of a point z ∈ Z∞, that
is, the smallest positive integer such that f
−k(z)
(z) ∈ Z∞. This is defined µ-almost
everywhere, by Poincar´e’s recurrence theorem. Observe also that µz = µf
j (z)
for
any z and any integer j. Thus, we can rewrite (32) as
µ(A) = Z
Z∞
k(z)µz(A) dµ(z)
for any measurable subset A of Z∞. The next lemma can be inferred from §3 of
Rokhlin [Rok62]. For the reader’s convenience, we state it explicitly and prove
it, after completing the proof of Lemma 6.1.
38
Lemma 6.2. Let λ be a finite measure on a measure space Z, with λ(Z) > 0.
Let K be a measurable partition of Z, and (λz)z∈Z be a family of finite measures
on Z such that
1. the function z 7→ λz(A) is measurable, and it is constant on each element
of K, for any measurable set A ⊂ Z
2. {w : λz = λw} is a measurable set with full λz-measure, for every z ∈ Z.
Assume that λ(A) = R
`(z)λz(A) dλ for some measurable function ` : Z → R+
and any measurable subset A of Z. Let {λ˜
γ, γ ∈ K}, and {λ˜
z,γ, γ ∈ K}, be
disintegrations of λ and λz, respectively, into conditional probability measures
along the elements of the partition K. Then
λ˜
z,γ = λ˜
γ
for λ-almost every z ∈ Z and λˆ
z-almost every γ, where λˆ
z is the quotient measure
induced by λz on K.
We take Z = Z∞, λ = (µ | Z∞), K = K∞ , λz = (µz | Z∞), and `(z) = k(z),
for each z ∈ Z∞. It is easy to check that the hypotheses of Lemma 6.1 are
satisfied. The first part of assumption 1 is contained in the ergodic decomposition
theorem, and the second part follows from (30), as we explained before. Let D
be any countable dense subset of the space of continuous functions on M. Given
z, w ∈ Z∞, then µz = µw if and only for every ϕ ∈ D and every p ≥ 1 there exists
q ≥ 1 such that

for any n ≥ p .
This gives the measurability condition in assumption 2. In this case the last part
of assumption 2 is just a restatement of the fact that λz = µz is ergodic.
Then, according to Lemma 6.2, the conditional probability measures ˜µz,γ of
(µz | Z∞) along the disks γ ∈ K∞ coincide almost everywhere with the corresponding conditional measures ˜µγ of (µ | Z∞). Recall that we had already
shown that the latter are almost everywhere absolutely continuous with respect
to Lebesgue measure mγ. We also have that
Z
Z∞
k(z)µz(Z∞) dµ = µ(Z∞) > 0.
It follows that there exists a positive µ-measure subset of points z ∈ Z∞ such
that µz(K∞ ∩ K) ≥ µz(Z∞) > 0, and the restriction of µz to Z∞ has conditional
measures with respect to K that are µz-almost everywhere absolutely continuous
39
with respect to Lebesgue measure on the corresponding disk γ ∈ K. Thus, any
such z satisfies the first two claims in the statement of the lemma.
Finally, since K is compact and positively invariant, ergodicity implies that
the support of µz is contained in ∩
∞
j=0f
j
(K).
Now we prove Lemma 6.2:
Proof. The idea is quite simple. Let E be the partition of the set Z into equivalence classes for the equivalence relation z ∼ w ⇔ λz = λw. Assumption 2
ensures that the elements of E are measurable sets, and assumption 1 implies
that every γ ∈ K is contained in some element of E. Given any e ∈ E we define
λe = λz, where z is an arbitrary point in e. We show that, up to normalization,
{λe, e ∈ E}, is a a disintegration of λ with respect to the partition E. Now,
{λ˜
e,γ = λ˜
z,γ, γ ∈ K, γ ⊂ e}, is a disintegration of λe = λz, with respect to the
partition induced by K on each e ∈ E. It follows that {λ˜
e,γ, γ ∈ K, γ ⊂ e,
e ∈ E}, is a disintegration of λ with respect to K (obtained by conditioning first
to E, then to K). By (essential) uniqueness of the disintegration into conditional
probability measures, we must have λ˜
z,γ = λ˜
γ almost everywhere.
Now we give the detailed argument. Let πγ : Z → K and πe : K → E be the
canonical projections. We represent by B(E) the σ-algebra generated by E. Let
g : Z → R+ be a conditional expectation of ` relative to E, that is, a RadonNikodym derivative, with respect to the restriction of λ to B(E), of the measure
defined by
B(E) 3 E 7→
Z
E
` dλ.
In other words, g is a B(E)-measurable function satisfying
Z
E
` dλ =
Z
E
g dλ for every E ∈ B(E). (33)
B(E)-measurability implies that g is constant on elements of E. Set g(e) = g(z)
for any e ∈ E and z ∈ e. Let us consider the set
{h : Z → R such that Z
`h dλ =
Z
gh dλ}.
By (33), every characteristic function of an element of B(E) is in this set. Using
linearity of the integral and the dominated convergence theorem, we conclude
that the set contains any bounded B(E)-measurable function. In particular, it
contains h(z) = λz(A), for any measurable set A ⊂ Z. Therefore,
λ(A) = Z
`(z)λz(A) dλ(z) = Z
g(z)λz(A) dλ(z) = Z
g(e)λe(A) de, (34)
40
where de = (πe ◦ πγ)∗λ is the quotient measure induced by λ on E. Assumption
2 implies that
g(e)λe(Z \ e) = 0 for any e ∈ E. (35)
Then,
g(e)λe(Z) = g(e)λe(e) = 1 for de-almost all e ∈ E. (36)
Indeed, let δ > 0 and Fδ be the set of all e ∈ E for which g(e)λe(Z) ≥ 1 + δ.
Denote Eδ = (πe ◦ πγ)
−1
(Fδ). Then, using (34) and (35),
de(Fδ) = λ(Eδ) = Z
g(e)λe(Eδ) de =
Z
Fδ
g(e)λe(Z) de ≥ (1 + δ)de(Fδ),
which implies de(Fδ) = 0. Analogously, the set of e ∈ E for which g(e)λe(Z) is
less than 1 − δ has zero de-measure for any δ > 0. This proves (36). In this way,
we have shown that {g(e)λe, e ∈ E} is a disintegration of λ with respect to the
partition E.
Now, for each e ∈ E, let λˆ
e = (πγ | e)∗λe be the quotient measure of λe on
(K | e). Moreover, let {λ˜
e,γ, γ ∈ K, γ ⊂ e} be a disintegration of λe with respect
to (K | e). Of course, λ˜
e,γ = λ˜
z,e for any z ∈ e. Then
λe(A) = Z
λ˜
e,γ(A) dλˆ
e(γ) and so g(e)λe(A) = Z
λ˜
e,γ(A) d(g(e)λˆ
e)(γ)
for any measurable set A ⊂ Z. Replacing this in (34), we find
λ(A) = Z Z λ˜
e,γ(A) d(g(e)λˆ
e)(γ) de. (37)
Denote dγ = (πγ)∗λ, the quotient measure of λ on K. Note that de = (πe)∗dγ,
that is, de coincides with the quotient measure of dγ on E. Moreover,
dγ(Γ) = λ(π
−1
γ
(Γ)) = Z
g(e)λe(π
−1
γ
(Γ)) de =
Z
g(e)λˆ
e(Γ) de
for every measurable set Γ ⊂ K. This means that {g(e)λˆ
e, e ∈ E}, is a disintegration of dγ with respect to the partition E. Thus (37) gives
λ(A) = Z
λ˜
e,γ(A) dγ,
and so {λ˜
e,γ, γ ∈ K}, is a disintegration of λ with respect to the partition K.
Since disintegrations into conditional probability measures, when they exist, are
uniquely defined almost everywhere, it follows that λ˜
e,γ = λ˜
γ for dγ-almost every
γ ∈ K. Equivalently, this holds for de-almost every e ∈ E and dλˆ
e-almost every
γ ∈ (K | e), which is just the same as the conclusion of the lemma.
41
Let z ∈ K∞ ∩ K be as in Lemma 6.1. Property 2. above implies that the
measure µ∗ = µz has dim E
cu Lyapunov exponents larger than − log σ. The
domination condition implies that all the other exponents are less than − log σ +
log λ < − log σ. So, by Pesin theory [Pes76], µz-almost every point x has a
local strong-unstable manifold which is an embedded disk whose backward orbits
approach the backward of x at the exponential rate log σ. Moreover, the disks
γ ∈ K∞ contain the local strong-unstable manifolds of points in their interior.
Combining these remarks with Lemma 6.1, we get
Theorem 6.3. Let f be a C
2 diffeomorphism admitting a positively invariant
compact set with a dominated splitting E
cs⊕E
cu. Assume that f is non-uniformly
expanding along the centre-unstable direction, cf. (29). Then f has some ergodic Gibbs cu-state µ∗ supported in ∩
∞
j=0f
j
(K): µ∗ is an invariant probability
measure whose dim E
cu larger Lyapunov exponents are positive and whose conditional measures along the corresponding local strong-unstable manifolds are almost everywhere absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on these
manifolds.
If the remaining dim E
cs Lyapunov exponents of µ∗ are all negative then µ∗
is an SRB measure. This is a well known consequence of the absolute continuity
property of µ∗ and absolute continuity of the stable lamination [Pes76]: the union
of the stable manifolds through the points whose time averages are given by µ∗
is a positive Lebesgue measure set contained in the basin of µ∗.
Clearly, the centre-stable Lyapunov exponents are indeed negative whenever
the subbundle E
cs is uniformly contracting, which was precisely our setting in
Sections 2 through 4. In general, if one assumes that E
cs is non-uniformly contracting

on a positive Lebesgue measure subset of H ⊂ D, it is not clear whether this
information can be passed to a limit Gibbs cu-state. There are however some cases
where this can be done, and so our methods do yield SRB measures supported
in K.
A sufficient condition is that there exist a positive Lebesgue measure set of
points in H with many (positive density at infinity) simultaneous σ-hyperbolic
times with respect to the two subbundles:

Proposition 6.4. In the setting of Theorem 6.3, suppose that every point H
has many (positive density at infinity) simultaneous σ-hyperbolic times for some
σ < 1. Then ergodic Gibbs cu-states can be constructed as in the theorem which
are SRB measures, and whose basins cover a full Lebesgue measure subset of H.
Proof. Let σ < 1 be fixed such that the subset H(σ) of points with many simultaneous σ-hyperbolic times has positive Lebesgue measure. Cf. (14) if n is a
σ-hyperbolic time (with respect to E
cu) then the tangent space at every point in
the ball of radius δ1 around f
n
(x) in f
n
(D) is uniformly contracted by the first
n negative iterates of f. Up to reducing δ1, we may also suppose that, whenever n is a simultaneous σ-hyperbolic time then the centre-stable subbundle is
σ
j/2
-expanded by these iterates f
−j
, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, at every point in that ball. We
construct measures νn as before, except that we take into account only simultaneous hyperbolic times. As a consequence, E
cs is σ
j/2
-expanded by all negative
iterates f
−j
, j ≥ 1, at every point in the support of the limit measure ν. In
particular, any ergodic Gibbs cu-state for which the support of ν has positive
measure must have dim E
cs negative Lyapunov exponents, and so it is an SRB
measure.
Moreover, as we have seen in the proof of the Claim in Lemma 4.5, a definite
fraction of measures νn is carried by disks where points in the corresponding
iterate of H(σ) occupy a subset with relative Lebesgue measure bounded away
from zero. Then it is easy to verify that the content of that Claim is valid for, at
least, some Gibbs cu-state µ∗ charging the support of ν: there exists a sequence
Dk of disks in f
jk (D) in which f
jk (H(σ)) has relative Lebesgue measure bounded
away from zero, converging to some disk D∞ in the support of µ∗, tangent to the
centre-unstable direction and such that almost every point in D∞ is in the basin
of µ∗. By Pesin theory (absolute continuity of the stable lamination [Pes76]) the
union of the stable manifolds of these points in D∞ ∩ B(µ∗) cuts Dk in a subset
with relative Lebesgue measure going to 1 as Dk approaches D∞. In particular,
since these stable manifolds are contained in B(µ∗), the basin must contain a
positive Lebesgue measure subset of H(σ). This proves that Lebesgue almost
every point in H(σ) is in the basin of some SRB measure, for every σ < 1.
Finally, we describe a simple condition on the diffeomorphism f implying
existence of many simultaneous hyperbolic times. This condition is satisfied by a
non-empty C
1 open set of diffeomorphisms of the 4-torus admitting an invariant
set with a dominated splitting (without uniformly hyperbolic subbundles), as will
be shown in the Appendix.
Proposition 6.5. Let f be a C

A Appendix: Applications
Here we present a few simple conditions implying the assumptions of Theorem A,
Corollary D, and Propositions 6.4 and 6.5. They allow us to exhibit some robust
(C
1 open) classes of maps to which these results apply.
Lemma A.1. Given a real number σ1 and integers p, q ≥ 1 with σ1 > q, there
exists ε0 > 0 such that the following holds. Let M be a manifold with finite volume,
f : M → M be a C
1 map, and {B1, . . . , Bp, Bp+1, . . . , Bp+q} be a covering of M
by measurable sets, such that
1. | det Df(x)| ≥ σ1 for every x in Bp+1 ∪ · · · Bp+q;
2. (f | Bi) is injective for all 1 ≤ i ≤ p + q.
Then the orbit of Lebesgue almost every point x ∈ M spends a fraction ε0 of the
time in B1 ∪ · · · ∪ Bp: that is, #{0 ≤ j < n : f
j
(x) ∈ B1 ∪ · · · ∪ Bp} ≥ ε0 n for
every large n.
44
Proof. Let n be fixed, for the time being. Given a sequence i = (i0, i1, . . . , in−1)
in {1, . . . , p + q}, we denote
[i] = Bi0 ∩ f
−1
(Bi1
) ∩ · · · ∩ f
−n+1(Bin−1
).
Moreover, we define g(i) to be the number of values of 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1 for which
ij ≤ p. We begin by noting that, given any ε0 > 0, the total number of sequences
i for which g(i) < ε0 n is bounded by
X

A standard application of Stirling’s formula (see e.g. [BV99, Section 6.3]) gives
that the last expression is bounded by e
γ0np
ε0 n
q
n
, where γ0 depends only on ε0
and goes to zero when ε0 goes to zero. On the other hand, as a consequence
of assumptions 1 and 2, Leb([i]) ≤ Leb(M) σ
−(1−ε0)n
1
. Then the measure of the
union In of all the sets [i] with g(i) < ε0 n is less than
Leb(M)σ
−(1−ε0)n

Since we supposed q < σ1, we may fix ε0 small so that e

. This means
that the Lebesgue measure of In goes to zero exponentially fast as n → ∞. Thus,
by the lemma of Borel-Cantelli, Lebesgue almost every point x ∈ M belongs in
only finitely many sets In. Clearly, any such point x satisfies the conclusion of
the lemma.
Proposition A.2. Given real numbers σ1, σ2 > 0 and integers p, q ≥ 1 such that
σ1 > q ≥ 1 > σ2, there exist δ0 > 0 and c0 > 0 such that the following holds. Let
M, f : M → M, and B1, . . . , Bp+q be as in Lemma A.1, and assume that
1. kDf(x)
−1k ≤ σ2 if x ∈ Bi, 1 ≤ i ≤ p, and
2. kDf(x)
−1k ≤ 1 + δ0 if x ∈ Bi, p + 1 ≤ i ≤ p + q.
Then f is non-uniformly expanding: for Lebesgue almost every point x ∈ M
lim sup

Proof. Let ε0 > 0 be the constant given by Lemma A.1. Then, fix δ0 > 0 small
enough so that σ

(1 + δ0) ≤ e

for some c0 > 0. Let x be any point satisfying
the conclusion of the lemma. Then

(1 + δ0)
(1−ε0)n ≤ e

for every large enough n, This means that x satisfies the conclusion of the proposition, so the proof is complete.
45
Remark A.3. We also proved that, for f as in Proposition A.2, the Lebesgue
measure of the set
{x ∈ M : kDfj
(x)
−1
k > e−c0j
for some j ≥ n}
goes to zero exponentially fast when n → ∞.
With the aid of this proposition we can exhibit an explicit construction of a
C
1 open class of maps satisfying the hypotheses of Corollary D. Let M be any
compact manifold supporting some uniformly expanding map f0: there exists
σ2 < 1 such that
kvk < σ2kDf0(x)vk for every x ∈ M and v ∈ TxM.
For instance, M could be the d-dimensional torus T
d
. Let V ⊂ M be some small
compact domain, so that the restriction of f0 to V is injective.
Corollary A.4. Let f1 be any C
1 map coinciding with f0 outside V , and such
that f1 is volume expanding everywhere, | det Df1(x)| > 1 for every x ∈ M,
and f is not too contracting on V : kDf1(x)
−1k ≤ 1 + δ0 for every x ∈ V and
some small enough δ0 > 0. Then every map f in a C
1
-neighbourhood N of f1 is
non-uniformly expanding.
Proof. Taking the C
1
-neighbourhood sufficiently small, we may assume that there
exists σ1 > 1 such that the Jacobian of every f in it is bounded from below by σ1.
Moreover, kDf(x)
−1k ≤ σ2 for every x outside V . Let B1, . . . , Bp, Bp+1 = V be
any partition of M into domains such that f is injective on each Bj
, 1 ≤ j ≤ p+1.
The claim follows from Proposition A.2, with q = 1.
Remark A.5. Maps f1 as in the statement can be obtained, e.g. through deformation of f0 by isotopy inside V . In general, these maps are not expanding:
deformation can be made in such way that f1 have periodic saddles.
Using very similar ideas one can also construct robust classes of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms (or, more generally, diffeomorphisms with a dominated
splitting) whose centre-unstable direction is non-uniformly expanding. We just
sketch the main points.
This time we start with a linear Anosov diffeomorphism f0 on the d-dimensional torus M = T
d
, d ≥ 2. We write TM = E
u ⊕ E
s
the corresponding hyperbolic
decomposition. Let V be a small closed domain in M, in the following sense: there
exist unit open cubes K0 and K1
in R
d
such that V ⊂ π(K0
) and f0(V ) ⊂ π(K1
),
where π : R
d → T
d
is the canonical projection. Now, let f be a diffeomorphism
on T
d
such that
46
(a) f admits invariant cone fields C
cu and C
cs, with small width α > 0 and
containing, respectively, the unstable bundle E
u and the stable bundle E
s
of the Anosov diffeomorphism f0;
(b) there is σ1 > 1 so that | det(Df | TxDcu)| > σ1 and | det(Df | TxDcs)| < σ−1
1
for any x ∈ M and any disks Dcu and Dcs through x tangent, respectively,
to the centre-unstable cone field C
cu and to centre-stable cone field C
cs
.
(c) f is C
1
-close to f0 in the complement of V , so that there exists σ2 < 1
satisfying
k(Df | TxD
cu)
−1
k < σ2 and k(Df | TxD
cs)k < σ2
for x ∈ (M \ V ) and any disks Dcu
, Dcs tangent to C
cu
, C
cs, respectively.
(d) there exists some small δ0 > 0 satisfying
k(Df | TxD
cu)
−1
k < (1 + δ0) and k(Df | TxD
cs)k < (1 + δ0)
for any x ∈ V and any disks Dcu
, Dcs tangent to C
cu
, C
cs, respectively.
Closeness in (c) should be enough to ensure that f(V ) is also contained in the
projection of a unit open cube.
For instance, if f1 is a torus diffeomorphism satisfying (a), (b), (d), and coinciding with f0 outside V , then any map f in a C
1 neighbourhood of f1 satisfies
all the previous conditions. The C
1 open classes of transitive non-Anosov diffeomorphisms presented in [BV99, Section 6], as well as other robust examples from
[Ma˜n78], are constructed in this way and they fit in the present setting: both
these diffeomorphisms and their inverses satisfy (a)–(d).
In what is left of this appendix, we argue that any f satisfying (a)–(d) is nonuniformly expanding along its centre-unstable direction. More precisely, condition
(2) in Theorem A holds, with limit bounded away from zero, on a full Lebesgue
set of points x ∈ M.
To explain this, let B1, . . . , Bp, Bp+1 = V be any partition of T
d
into small
domains, in the same sense as before: there exist open unit cubes K0
i
and K1
i
in
R
d
such that
Bi ⊂ π(K0
i
) and f(Bi) ⊂ π(K1
i
). (40)
Let F
u
0 be the unstable foliation of f0, and Fj = f
j
(F
u
0
) for every j ≥ 0. By
(a), each Fj
is a foliation of T
d
tangent to the centre-unstable cone field C
cu. For
any subset E of a leaf of Fj
, j ≥ 0, we denote Lebj (E) the Lebesgue measure of
E inside that leaf.
47
Fix any small disk D0 contained in a leaf of the foliation F0. Then, for any
sequence i = (i0, . . . , in−1) in {1, . . . , p, p + 1}, define
[i] = {x ∈ D0 : f
j
(x) ∈ Bij
for 0 ≤ j < n}.
Claim: There exists C0 > 0 depending only on f such that Leb0([i]) ≤ C0σ
−n
1
for every sequence i as above.
Proof. Indeed, let F˜
j be the lift to R
d of Fj
, for j ≥ 0. Using (40) one can easily
conclude, by induction on j, that f
j
([i]) is contained in the image π(K1
j−1 ∩ F˜
j )
of the intersection of K1
j−1 with some leaf F˜
j of F˜
j
, for every 0 ≤ j ≤ n. So,
using (b) and the fact that (π | K1
n−1
) is a diffeomorphism and an isometry onto
its image,
Leb0([i]) ≤ σ
−n
1 Lebn(f
n
([i])) ≤ σ
−n
1 Lebn(Fn ∩ K1
n−1
). (41)
Recall that we took f0 linear, so that its unstable foliation F
u
0
lifts to a foliation
F˜u
0
of R
d by affine hyperplanes. The leaves of every F˜
n are C
1
submanifolds of R
d
transverse to these hyperplanes, with angles uniformly bounded away from zero
at every intersection point. Consequently, the intersection of a leaf of F˜
n with
any unit cube in R
d has Lebesgue measure (inside the leaf) bounded by some
uniform constant C0. In particular, the last factor in (41) is bounded by C0.
Now, using the same arguments as in Lemma A.1, we may conclude that
Leb0-almost every point x ∈ D0 spends a positive fraction ε0 of the time outside
the domain V . Then, using assumptions (c) and (d) above, there exists c0 > 0
such that
lim sup
n→∞
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
log k(Df|E
cu
f
j (x)
)
−1
k ≤ −c0
for Leb0-almost every point x ∈ D0. Since D0 was an arbitrary disk inside a leaf
of F
s
0
, and the latter is an absolutely continuous foliation, we conclude that f is
non-uniformly expanding along E
cu, Lebesgue almost everywhere in M = T
d
.
Remark A.6. These arguments also show that f is non-uniformly contracting
along the centre-stable direction, if it satisfies (a)–(d): Lebesgue almost every
x ∈ M has
lim sup
n→∞
1
n
Xn−1
j=0
log kDf|E
cs
f
j (x)
k ≤ −c0 .
Finally, reducing δ0 if necessary (this can be done without changing c0), we
can make Au = sup − log kDf −1
| E
cuk and As = sup log kDf | E
csk arbitrarily
close to zero. In particular, c0/Au + c0/As > 1, as in Proposition 6.5.

Abstract We consider invertible discrete-time dynamical systems having a hyperbolic
product structure in some region of the phase space with infinitely many branches and variable return time. We show that the decay of correlations of the SRB measure associated to
that hyperbolic structure is related to the tail of the recurrence times. We also give sufficient
conditions for the validity of the Central Limit Theorem. This extends previous results by
Young in (Ann. Math. 147: 585–650, 1998; Israel J. Math. 110: 153–188, 1999).

1 Introduction
One of the most powerful ways of describing the dynamical features of chaotic dynamical
systems is through invariant probability measures, meaning that the probability of finding
an orbit in a certain region of the phase space does not depend on the moment we consider.
A map f is said to be mixing with respect to an invariant probability measure μ if
|μ(f −n(A) ∩ B) − μ(A)μ(B)| → 0, when n → ∞,
for any measurable sets A,B. Standard counterexamples show that in general there is no
specific rate at which this convergence to zero occurs. However, defining the correlation

it is sometimes possible to obtain specific rates of decay, which depend only on the map f
(up to a multiplicative constant which is allowed to depend on ϕ and ψ), provided the
observables ϕ and ψ have sufficient regularity. Notice that choosing these observables
to be characteristic functions this gives exactly the definition of mixing. Still in this direction, the Central Limit Theorem states that the probability of a given deviation of the
time average values from the spatial average is essentially given by a Normal Distribution.
Since the work of Bowen, Ruelle and Sinai [3, 7, 8] it is known that uniformly hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms (Axiom A, Anosov) possess SRB (or physical) measures with exponential
decay of correlations and satisfying the Central Limit Theorem. A key ingredient in the
results of Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen are Markov partitions, which permit to deduce many
statistical properties of the dynamical system through a codification of the dynamics.
In the context of non-uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, Young considered in [10]
some Markov structures, in certain regions of the phase space, with infinitely many branches
and variable return times. This structures played a key role in obtaining exponential decay
of correlations and deduce the Central Limit Theorem for some classes of non-uniformly
hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, including billiards with convex scatterers and Axiom A attractors. Still in this context we refer the work of Benedicks and Young in [2] where they also get
exponential decay of correlations and deduce the Central Limit Theorem for Hénon maps.
This approach has also been successfully implemented by Young in [11] for studying other
rates of mixing of non-invertible dynamical systems.
The framework developed by Young in [10, 11] is certainly among the most powerful
tools for studying the statistical properties of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems.
In both approaches, there is an explicit relation between the tail of the recurrence times
to the hyperbolic structure and the decay of correlations, at least for some specific rates.
However, the results in both papers do not depict the whole scenario: on the one hand, the
model in [10] can only be applied to systems whose decay of correlations is exponential; on
the other hand, the model in [11], in spite of being suitable for other decay rates, is specific
to non-invertible systems. A simple diffeomorphism as the solenoid with intermittency that
we present in Sect. 2.4 does not fit the model in [10]; see Remark 2.4.
A reduction of the diffeomorphism case to an endomorphism has been successfully implemented in [10] for systems with exponential decay of return time. This reduction has not
been carried out for other decays. Here we mix techniques from [10, 11] and fill in this gap.
Hyperbolic structures with subexponential tail of recurrence times will certainly play an important role in obtaining the rates of mixing for the diffeomorphisms introduced by Viana
in [9]. Such hyperbolic structures can also be useful in the study of some classes of billiards
and Poincaré return maps for flows, for which the tails of recurrence frequently decay at
subexponential rates.
Overview This work is organized in the following way. In Sect. 2 we present our main
results. For that we present the hyperbolic structures that appeared in [2, 10] and introduce
a diameter control on certain iterates of the elements in the hyperbolic structures. This diameter control plays a crucial role in our subexponential results. In Sect. 3 we consider an
induced scheme with a tower extension and reduce the problem to the non-invertible case.
Slow Rates of Mixing for Dynamical Systems with Hyperbolic 507
For this we need a careful control on the constants of the main results in [11]; we do this in
Appendix A for the sake of completeness. We derive the results for the original dynamics
in Sect. 4. Finally, a solenoid with intermittency is presented as an illustrating example in
Sect. 5.
2 Statement of Results
2.1 Hyperbolic Structures
Consider f : M → M, where M is a finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and let Leb
be the Lebesgue measure on the Borel sets of M. Given a submanifold γ ⊂ M we use Lebγ
to denote the measure on γ induced by the restriction of the Riemannian structure to γ .
An embedded disk γ ⊂ M is called an unstable manifold if dist(f −n(x),f −n(y)) → 0
exponentially fast as n → ∞ for every x,y ∈ γ . Similarly, γ is called a stable manifold if
dist(f n(x),f n(y)) → 0 exponentially fast as n → ∞ for every x,y ∈ γ .
Definition 2.1 Let Emb1
(Du,M) be the space of C1 embeddings from a disk Du into M.
We say that u = {γ u} is a continuous family of C1 unstable manifolds if there is a compact
set Ks, a unit disk Du of some Rn, and a map u : Ks × Du → M such that
(i) γ u = u({x} × Du) is an unstable manifold;
(ii) u maps Ks × Du homeomorphically onto its image;
(iii) x → u | ({x} × Du) defines a continuous map from Ks into Emb1
(Du,M).
Continuous families of C1 stable manifolds are defined similarly.
Definition 2.2 We say that  ⊂ M has a hyperbolic product structure if there exist a continuous family of unstable manifolds u = {γ u} and a continuous family of stable manifolds
s = {γ s
} such that
(i)  = (
γ u) ∩ (
γ s
);
(ii) dimγ u + dimγ s = dimM;
(iii) each γ s meets each γ u in exactly one point;
(iv) stable and unstable manifolds are transversal with angles bounded away from 0.
Let  ⊂ M have a hyperbolic product structure, whose defining families are s and u.
A subset 0 ⊂  is called an s-subset if 0 also has a hyperbolic product structure and its
defining families s
0 and u
0 can be chosen with s
0 ⊂ s and u
0 = u; u-subsets are defined
analogously. Given x ∈ , let γ ∗(x) denote the element of ∗ containing x, for ∗ = s,u. For
each n ≥ 1 let (f n)u denote the restriction of the map f n to γ u-disks, and let det D(f n)u be
the Jacobian of D(f n)u. We require that the hyperbolic product structure  satisfies several
properties:
(P1) Markov: there are pairwise disjoint s-subsets 1,2,... ⊂  such that
(a) Lebγ (( \
i) ∩ γ) = 0 on each γ ∈ u;
(b) for each i ∈ N there is Ri ∈ N such that f Ri(i) is u-subset, and for all x ∈ i
f Ri(γ s
(x)) ⊂ γ s
(f Ri(x)) and f Ri(γ u(x)) ⊃ γ u(f Ri(x)).
508 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
In the statements of the remaining properties about the hyperbolic structure we assume
that C > 0 and 0 <β< 1 are constants which only depend on f and .
(P2) Contraction on stable leaves: dist(f n(y),f n(x)) ≤ Cβn, ∀y ∈ γ s
(x) ∀n ≥ 1.
In spite of the uniform contraction in the stable direction, this condition is not too restrictive in systems having regions where the contraction fails to be uniform, since we are
allowed to remove points in the unstable leaves, provided a subset with positive measure in
those leaves remains at the end. This has been carried out in [2] for Hénon maps.
Next we introduce a return time function R :  → N and a return map f R :  → ,
defined for each i ∈ N as
R|i = Ri and f R|i = f Ri |i .
We consider the separation time s(x,y) for x,y ∈  as
s(x,y) = min
n ≥ 0: (f R)
n(x) and (f R)
n(y) lie in distinct i

.
The last two properties involve information on the action of f R on unstable leaves.
(P3) Regularity of the stable foliation: given γ,γ  ∈ u, we define 	: γ  ∩  → γ ∩  by
	(x) = γ s
(x) ∩ γ . Then
(a) 	 is absolutely continuous and
d(	∗ Lebγ )
d Lebγ
(x) =∞
i=0
det Df u(f i
(x))
det Df u(f i(	−1(x)));
(b) letting u(x) denote the density in item (a), we have
log u(x)
u(y) ≤ Cβs(x,y), for x,y ∈ γ  ∩ .
(P4) Bounded distortion: for γ ∈ u and x,y ∈  ∩ γ
log
det D(f R)u(x)
det D(f R)u(y) ≤ Cβs(f R(x),f R(y)).
Remark 2.3 The Markov property we present here is weaker than the one in [10], since
includes two extra assumptions: (i) there are at most finitely many i’s with Ri = n for each
n ∈ N; (ii) Ri ≥ R0 for some R0 > 1 depending on the constants C and α. These assumptions
play a role in showing the existence of a spectral gap for a transfer operator associated to the
dynamics. Here we use a more probabilistic argument, based on [11], which enables us to
drop those extra assumptions. In particular, we are able to reobtain the conclusions of [10]
under our weaker Markov condition.
Remark 2.4 We do not assume any uniform backward contraction along unstable leaves
similar to (P4) (a) in [10]. This would be too restrictive for our purposes, since the application we make of our main results does not have this property. Properties (P3)(b) and (P4) are
new if comparing our setup to the one in [10]. However, they can be easily obtained from
(P4) and (P5) in [10]; see [10, Lemma 1].

2.2 Diameter Control
Consider a sequence of stopping times defined for the points in  in the following way:
S0 = 0, S1 = R and Si+1 = Si + R ◦ f Si, for i ≥ 1. (1)
We also define a nested sequence (Pk )k≥0 of partitions of . Let P0 be the partition of 
into the subsets i. Given k ≥ 1, we say that x and y belong to an element of Pk , if both
conditions hold:
(i) f R(x) and f R(y) have the same stopping times S1 < ··· < Sj up to time k − 1;
(ii) f Si(f R(x)) and f Si(f R(y)) belong to the same element of P0 for each 0 ≤ i ≤ j .
By construction we have that Sj+1(f R(x)) = Sj+1(f R(y)) ≥ k and f Sj+1 (f R(Q)) is a
u-subset.
We shall need to have a control on the diameter of certain iterates of the elements in
the partitions defined above; see the proof of Lemma 3.2. Take any k ≥ 1 and P ∈ P0. We
consider separately the cases where k is bigger than R(P) − 1 or not. If k > R(P) − 1, then
we define
δk (P) = sup 0≤≤R(P)−1

diam(f 
(Q ∩ γ)): γ ∈ u,Q ∈ Pk−R(P)+1+,Q ⊂ P

.
On the other hand, if k ≤ R(P) − 1, then we define the quantities
δ0
k (P) = sup 0≤<R(P)−k

diam(f 
(P ∩ γ)): γ ∈ u
,
δ+
k (P) = sup
R(P)−k≤≤R(P)−1

diam(f 
(Q ∩ γ)): γ ∈ u,Q ∈ Pk−R(P)+1+,Q ⊂ P

,
and
δk (P) = sup{δ0
k (P),δ+
k (P)}.
Finally we define
δk = sup
P∈P0
δk (P). (2)
Though the definition of δk might seem somewhat technical, this is not so hard to calculate in practice, at least for some examples. One we have in mind is the solenoid with
intermittency that we present in Sect. 2.4, for which we show in Sect. 5.2 that δk decays
polynomially fast with k.
Remark 2.5 The argument in Sect. 5.2 can easily be adapted to show that δk decays exponentially fast with k, once we know that the diameter of the elements i decay exponentially
fast with Ri. This includes all the examples studied in [10], since property (P4)(a) in [10]
gives the exponential decay for the diameters of the elements in the initial partition with
respect to the return time.
Remark 2.6 In the light of Definition 2.6 in [1] one may say that δk decays exponentially
fast with k whenever the return time Ri is a hyperbolic time for the points in i with respect
to the derivative restricted to the tangent direction of the leaves in u; see [1, Lemma 2.7]
and recall Remark 2.5.

2.3 Main Results
The first result we present here asserts the existence of SRB measures for systems having
some hyperbolic structure, provided the return time is integrable with respect to the conditional of the Lebesgue measure on some local unstable leaf.
Definition 2.7 We say that an f -invariant probability measure μ is a Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen
(SRB) measure if f has no zero Lyapunov exponents μ almost everywhere, and the conditional measures on local unstable manifolds are absolutely continuous with respect to the
Lebesgue measures on these manifolds.
The proof of the next result is quite standard and may be found in [10].
Theorem A Assume that f has a hyperbolic structure  such that Lebγ ( ∩ γ)> 0 for
some γ ∈ u. If R is integrable with respect to Lebγ , then f has some SRB measure μ.
The next result shows that the decay of correlations of the SRB measure μ given by Theorem A is related to the recurrence times of the hyperbolic structure. It has been established
by Young in [10, Theorem 2] a version of this result for hyperbolic structures having exponential decay of return time. The method in [10] is based on the existence of a spectral
gap for the transfer operator and cannot be applied in our situation. We define the space of
Hölder continuous functions with exponent η > 0
Hη = 
ϕ : M → R | ∃C > 0 such that |ϕ(x) − ϕ(y)| ≤ C dist(x,y)η,∀x,y ∈ M
.
Theorem B Assume that f has a hyperbolic structure  for which (P1)–(P4) hold, with
gcd{Ri} = 1 and Lebγ ( ∩ γ)> 0 for some γ ∈ u. Given ϕ,ψ ∈ Hη,
(1) if Lebγ {R>n}  n−α for some α > 1, then Cn(ϕ,ψ;μ)  max{n−α+1,δη
n};
(2) if Lebγ {R>n}  e−cnζ
for some c > 0 and 0 < ζ ≤ 1, then there exists c > 0 such that
Cn(ϕ,ψ;μ)  max{e−c
nζ
,δη
n}.
As shown in [10, Sect. 4.1], condition gcd{Ri} = 1 can be replaced by the assumption
that f n is ergodic with respect to μ for every n ≥ 1. If we omit both assumptions, then
the same conclusion holds for some power of f . The next result gives the Central Limit
Theorem for Hölder continuous observables which are not a coboundary with respect to the
SRB measure μ.
Theorem C Under the assumptions of Theorem B, if Lebγ {R>n}  n−α for some α > 2,
then given ϕ ∈ Hη for which there is no ψ ∈ L2(μ) with ϕ = ψ ◦ f − ψ there exists σ > 0
such that for every interval J ⊂ R,

2.4 Application
We give a diffeomorphism for which we may apply our main results and deduce that it has
an SRB measure with polynomial decay of correlations. This is obtained by perturbing the

classical solenoid map in the unstable direction of one fixed point and transforming it into
an indifferent fixed point. Let f : S1 → S1 be a map of degree d ≥ 2 with the following
properties:
(i) f is C2 on S1 \ {0};
(ii) f is C1 on S1 and f  > 1 on S1 \ {0};
(iii) f (0) = 0, f 
(0) = 1, and there is γ > 0 such that
−xf (x) ≈ |x|
γ for all x = 0.
Consider the solid torus M = S1 × D2, where D2 is the unit disk in R2, and define the map
g : M → M by
g(x,y,z) =


f (x),
1
10 y +
1
2 cos x,
1
10 z +
1
2
sin x

.
Let Hη be the space of Hölder continuous functions on M with exponent η > 0.
Theorem D Let g : M → M be as above and take ϕ,ψ ∈ Hη.
(1) The map g admits an SRB measure μ if and only if γ < 1.
(2) Assume that γ < 1. Then
(a) for η ≥ 1 − γ we have Dn(ϕ,ψ;μ)  n1−1/γ ;
(b) for η < 1 − γ we have Dn(ϕ,ψ;μ)  n−η/γ .
(3) If γ < 1/2, then the Central Limit Theorem holds for ϕ ∈ Hη, provided there is no
ψ ∈ L2(μ) with ϕ = ψ ◦ f − ψ.
It is well known that for γ ≥ 1 one has 1
n
n−1
j=0 δf j (x) converging in the weak* topology
to the Dirac measure at 0 for Lebesgue almost every x ∈ S1; see for example [5, 6]. Using
the fact that we have uniform contraction in the vertical direction, it is not hard to see that
1
n
n−1
j=0 δgj (x,y) converges in the weak* topology to the Dirac measure at 0 for Lebesgue
almost every (x,y) ∈ S1 × D2. This observation justifies the “only if” part of the theorem
above.
3 Induced Schemes
Here we consider an induced scheme with a tower extension and reduce the problem to a
non-invertible case. We follow closely the approach in [10].
3.1 The Natural Measure
Fix an arbitrary γˆ ∈ u. Given γ ∈ u and x ∈ γ ∩  let xˆ be the point in γ s
(x) ∩ ˆγ .
Defining for x ∈ γ ∩ 
u(x) ˆ =∞
i=0
det Df u(f i
(x))
det Df u(f i(x)) ˆ
we have that uˆ satisfies the bounded distortion property (P3)(b). For each γ ∈ u let mγ be
the measure in γ such that
dmγ
d Lebγ
= ˆu1γ∩,
512 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
where 1γ∩ is the characteristic function of the set γ ∩ . These measures have been defined
in such a way that if γ,γ  ∈ u and 	 is obtained by sliding along stable leaves from γ ∩ 
to γ  ∩ , then
	∗mγ = mγ . (3)
To verify this let us show that the densities of these two measures with respect to Lebγ
coincide. Take x ∈ γ ∩  and x ∈ γ  ∩  such that 	(x) = x
. By (P3)(a) one has
d	∗ Lebγ
d Lebγ 
(x
) = u(x ˆ 
)
u(x) ˆ ,
which implies that
d	∗mγ
d Lebγ 
(x
) = ˆu(x)
d	∗ Lebγ
d Lebγ 
(x
) = ˆu(x
) = dmγ 
d Lebγ 
(x
).
Lemma 3.1 Assuming that f R(γ ∩) ⊂ γ  for γ,γ  ∈ u, let Jf R(x) denote the Jacobian
of f R with respect to the measures mγ and mγ  . Then
(1) Jf R(x) = Jf R(y) for every y ∈ γ s
(x);
(2) there is C1 > 0 such that for every x,y ∈  ∩ γ




Jf R(x)
Jf R(y) − 1




≤ C1βs(f R(x),f R(y)).
Proof (1) For Lebγ almost every x ∈ γ ∩  we have
Jf R(x) =
det D(f R)
u(x)
 ·
u(f ˆ R(x))
u(x) ˆ . (4)
Denoting ϕ(x) = log | det Df u(x)| we may write
log Jf R(x) = 	R−1

Thus we have shown that Jf R(x) can be expressed just in terms of xˆ and f
R(x), which is
enough for proving the first part of the lemma.
(2) It follows from (4) that
log Jf R(x)
Jf R(y) = log
det D(f R)u(x)
det D(f R)u(y) + log u(f ˆ R(x))
u(f ˆ R(y)) + log u(y) ˆ
u(x) ˆ .
Observing that s(x,y) > s(f R(x),f R(y)) the conclusion follows from (P3)(b) and (P4).

3.2 A Tower Extension
We introduce a tower extension of the dynamical system f restricted to 
n≥0 f n(); note
that this space is preserved by f . We define a tower
 = 
(x,): x ∈  and 0 ≤  < R(x)
,
and a tower map F :  →  as
F(x,) =

(x, + 1), if  + 1 < R(x);
(f R(x), 0), if  + 1 = R(x).
The th level of the tower is by definition the set
 = {(x,) ∈ }.
The 0th-level of the tower 0 is naturally identified with  and we shall make no distinction
between them. Under this identification it easily follows from the definitions that F R = f R
for each x ∈ 0. Note that the th level of the tower is a copy of the set {R>} ⊂ 0.
Also, we easily obtain a partition P of 0 into subsets 0,i, with 0,i = i for i ≥ 1. This
partition gives rise to partitions ,i on each tower level , considering
,i = {(x,) ∈  : x ∈ 0,i}.
Collecting all these sets we obtain a partition Q = {,i},i of . We introduce a sequence
of partitions (Qn)n≥0 of  in the following way:
Q0 = Q, and Qn = n
i=0
F −i
Q for n ≥ 0. (5)
We shall denote by Qn(x) the element in Qn containing the point x ∈ .
We define a projection map
π:  −→ 
n≥0
f n(0),
(6)
(x,) −→ f 
(x).
Observe that f ◦ π = π ◦ F.
Lemma 3.2 There is C2 > 0 such that for all k ≥ 0 and Q ∈ Q2k
diam(πFk
(Q)) ≤ C2 max{βk
,δk }.
Proof Take k ≥ 0 and Q ∈ Q2k . Given x,y ∈ Q, there is z ∈ γ u(x) ∩ γ s
(y). Supposing that
Q ⊂ , then y0 = πF −(y) and z0 = πF −(z) are both in 0 and they lie on the same
stable leaf. Hence
514 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
dist(πFk
(y),πFk
(z)) = dist(πFk+
(y0),πFk+
(z0))
= dist(f k+
(πy0),πf k+
(πz0)).
Using (P2) we get
dist(πFk
(y),πFk
(z)) ≤ Cβk+
. (7)
On the other hand, we have Fk (Q) ∈ Qk , which implies that Fk (x) and Fk (z) are both
in an unstable leaf of some element of Qk . In particular, there are P ∈ P0 and  < R(P)
such that element of Qk is in the -th level of the tower over P . Moreover, the situations
considered for defining δk (P) correspond precisely to the possible cases for the elements of
Qk over P . Taking into account the definition of π, this gives
dist(πFk
(x),πFk
(z)) ≤ δk (P),
which together with (7) gives the desired conclusion.
Let m be the measure on  whose conditional measures on γ ∩  with γ ∈ u are the
measures mγ introduced in the previous section. This measure m allows us to introduce a
measure on  that we still denote m, by letting m| be the measure induced by the natural
identification of  with a subset of . We let JF denote the Jacobian of F with respect to
this measure m.
Lemma 3.3 There is CF > 0 such that for all k ≥ 1 and all x,y ∈  belonging to a same
element of Qk−1




JFk (x)
JFk (y) − 1




≤ CF βs(Fk (x),Fk (y)).
Proof By Lemma 3.1 one knows that for all i ≥ 1 and all x,y ∈ 0,i




JF R(x)
JF R(y) − 1




≤ C1βs(F R(x),F R(y)). (8)
It follows that there is a constant CF > 0 such that for all n ≥ 1 and all x,y belonging to a
same element of ∨n−1
j=0(F R)−jP




J(F R)n(x)
J(F R)n(y) − 1




≤ CF βs((F R)n(x),(F R)n(y)). (9)
In fact, if x and y belong to a same element of ∨n−1
j=0(F R)−jP, then (F R)j (x) and (F R)j (y)
belong to a same element of P for every 0 ≤ j<n. Moreover,

, by (8) and (10)
≤ CF βs((F R)n(x),(F R)n(y)), (11)
where CF > 0 depends only on C1 and β. This implies that (9) holds.
From (9) we easily deduce that for all k ≥ 1 and all x,y ∈  belonging to a same element
of Qk−1




JFk (x)
JFk (y) − 1




≤ CF βs(Fk (x),Fk (y)). (12)
To see this, we consider JFk (x) = J(F R)n(x
) and JFk (y) = J(F R)n(y
), where n is the
number of visits of x and y to 0 prior to time k, and x
,y are the elements in the bottom
level 0 corresponding x,y, respectively. In this way, we have x
,y belonging to a same
element of n−1
j=0(F R)−jP and s(x,y) = s(x
,y
). Using (9) we obtain (12).
3.3 Quotient Dynamics
Let ¯ = / ∼, where x ∼ y if and only if y ∈ γ s
(x). This quotient space gives rise to a
quotient tower ¯ with levels ¯  = / ∼. A partition of ¯ into ¯ 0,i, that we denote by P¯,
and a sequence Q¯ n of partitions of ¯ as in (5) are defined in a natural way.
As f R takes γ s-leaves to γ s-leaves and R has been defined in such a way that it does
not depend on the point we take in a same stable leaf, we may assume that we have defined the return time R¯ : ¯ 0 → N, the tower map F¯ : ¯ → ¯ and the separation time
s¯: ¯ 0 × ¯ 0 → N naturally induced by the corresponding ones in 0 and . It will be convenient to have this separation time defined in the whole ¯ . This may be done by taking
s(x,y) ¯ = ¯s(x
,y
) if x and y belong in a same ¯ l,i, where x
,y are the corresponding
elements of ¯ 0,i, and s(x,y) ¯ = 0 otherwise.
Since (3) holds, we may introduce a measure m¯ on ¯ whose representative on each
γ ∈ u is mγ . We let JF¯ denote the Jacobian of F¯ with respect to this measure m¯ . The
first item of Lemma 3.1 shows that the Jacobian JF¯ is well defined with respect to m¯ . From
Lemma 3.3 we easily obtain:
Lemma 3.4 For all k ≥ 1 and all x,y ∈ ¯ belonging to a same element of Q¯ k−1




JF¯ k (x)
JF¯ k (y) − 1




≤ CF βs(¯ F¯ k (x),F¯ k (y)).
It will be useful to consider Rˆ : ¯ −→ N defined as
R(x) ˆ = min{n ≥ 0: F¯ n(x) ∈ ¯ 0}.
Note that R(x) ˆ = R(x) ¯ for all x ∈ ¯ 0, and
m¯{R>n ˆ } =	
l>n
m(¯ ¯ l) =	
l>n
m¯{R>l ¯ }.
We introduce the spaces of Hölder functions in ¯
Fβ =

ϕ : ¯ → R | ∃Cϕ > 0 such that |ϕ(x) − ϕ(y)| ≤ Cϕβs(x,y) ¯ for all x,y ∈ ¯

ϕ > 0 and

≤ Cϕβs(x,y) ¯ for all x,y ∈ ¯ ,i
.
The following result gives the existence of an equilibrium measure for the tower map and
some of its properties. A proof of it is given in [10, Lemma 2] and [11, Theorem 1].
Theorem 3.5 Assume that R¯ is integrable with respect to m¯ . Then
(1) F¯ has a unique absolutely continuous invariant probability ν¯ equivalent to m¯ ;
(2) dν/d ¯ m¯ belongs to F+
β and is bounded from below by some c > 0;
(3) (F,¯ ν)¯ is exact and, hence ergodic and mixing.
The decay of correlations for the measure ν¯ has been proved in [10]. This occurs at the
same speed that the positive iterates under F¯
∗ of measures with densities in F+
β converge
to the equilibrium ν¯. This speed is related to the decay of m¯{R>n ¯ }, at least for some
specific rates.
Theorem 3.6 For ϕ ∈ F+
β let λ¯ be the measure whose density with respect to m¯ is ϕ.
(1) If m¯{R>n ¯ } ≤ Cn−ζ , for some C > 0 and ζ > 1, then there is C > 0 such that

F¯ n
∗ λ¯ − ¯ν

 ≤ C
n−ζ+1
.
(2) If m¯{R>n ¯ } ≤ Ce−cnη
, for some C,c > 0 and 0 < η ≤ 1, then there are C
,c > 0 such
that

F¯ n
∗ λ¯ − ¯ν

 ≤ C
e−c
nη
.
Moreover, c does not depend on ϕ and C depends only on Cϕ .
A version of this theorem has been proved in [10, Theorem 2] but without establishing
the dependence on the constants. This plays a crucial role in our proofs of Theorem B and
Theorem C. Following the arguments in [10] we give a detailed proof of Theorem 3.6 in
Appendix A.
4 Back to the Original Dynamics
Let π be the map from  to M defined in (6). Let also π¯ be the projection from  to the
quotient space ¯ . As observed in [10, Sects. 2 and 4] we have ν¯ = ¯π∗ν and μ = π∗ν. Given
ϕ,ψ ∈ Hη we define ψ˜ = ψ ◦ π and ϕ˜ = ϕ ◦ π.
4.1 Decay of Correlations
For proving Theorem B we start by noting that for ϕ,ψ ∈ Hη we have

(ϕ ◦ f n)ψdμ −

ψdμ =

(ϕ˜ ◦ Fn)ψdν ˜ −

ϕdν ˜

ψdν, ˜
Slow Rates of Mixing for Dynamical Systems with Hyperbolic 517
which shows that it suffices to obtain the desired conclusions for Cn(ϕ,˜ ψ˜ ; ν). This will be
done in several steps, firstly reducing it to a problem in ¯ and then applying Theorem 3.6.
Step 1 Fix some positive integer k ≤ n/4. Consider a discretization ϕ¯k of ϕ˜ defined on 
(or ¯ ) as
ϕ¯k |A = inf{ ˜ϕ ◦ Fk
(x): x ∈ A}, for A ∈ Q2k .
We have
|Cn(ϕ,˜ ψ˜ ; ν) − Cn−k (ϕ¯k ,ψ˜ ; ν)| ≤ C3δ
η
k (13)
for some C3 depending only on Cϕ and ψ∞.
Actually, by Lemma 3.2 one knows that | ˜ϕ ◦ Fk − ¯ϕk | ≤ Cϕ(C2δk )η. To be precise, one
should consider the case βk > δk , but this would only be relevant in the second part of
Theorem B. However, it does not play any special role for the conclusion.
Observing that Cn(ϕ,˜ ψ˜ ; ν) = Cn−k (ϕ˜ ◦ Fk ,ψ˜ ; ν), the left-hand side of inequality (13) is
≤

We just have to take C3 = 2CϕCη
2 ψ∞.
Step 2 Consider ψ¯ k defined similarly to ϕ¯k above. Let ψ¯ kν denote the signed measure whose
density with respect to ν is ψ¯ k , and let ψ˜ k denote the density of Fk
∗ (ψ¯ kν) with respect to ν.
Then
|Cn−k (ϕ¯k ,ψ˜ ; ν) − Cn−k (ϕ¯k,ψ˜ k ; ν)| ≤ C4δ
η
k , (14)
for some C4 depending only on Cψ and ϕ∞.
In fact, the left-hand side of (14) is

Letting |·| denote the total variation of a signed measure, and noting that
Fk
∗ ((ψ˜ ◦ Fk

we have





(ψ˜ − ψ˜ k )dν




= |ψν˜ − ψ˜ kν|=|Fk
∗ ((ψ˜ ◦ Fk
)ν) − Fk
∗ (ψ¯ kν)|
≤ |(ψ˜ ◦ Fk − ψ¯ k )ν| =
|ψ˜ ◦ Fk − ψ¯ k |dν.
By Lemma 3.2 one has |ψ˜ ◦ Fk − ψ¯ k | ≤ Cψ (C2δk )η. Take C4 = 2Cψ Cη
2 ϕ∞.
Step 3 Now we show that
Cn−k (ϕ¯k,ψ˜ k ; ν) = Cn(ϕ¯k ,ψ¯ k ; ¯ν). (15)
518 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
Indeed,

(ϕ¯k ◦ Fn−k
)ψ˜ kdν =

ϕ¯kd(Fn−k ∗ (ψ˜ kν)) =

ϕ¯kd(Fn
∗ (ψ¯ kν)),
and since ϕ¯k is constant on γ s leaves and F and F¯ are semi-conjugated by π¯ , we have

ϕ¯kd(Fn
∗ (ψ¯ kν)) =

ϕ¯kd(π¯∗Fn
∗ (ψ¯ kν)) =

ϕ¯kd(F¯ n
∗ (ψ¯ kν)) ¯ =

(ϕ¯k ◦ Fn)ψ¯ kdν.¯
Thus we have proved that

(ϕ¯k ◦ Fn−k

(ϕ¯k ◦ Fn)ψ¯ kdν.¯
On the other hand,

ϕ¯kdν ·

ψ˜ kdν =

ϕ¯kdν¯ ·

d(Fk
∗ (ψ¯ kν)) =

ϕ¯kdν¯ ·

ψ¯ kdν.¯
These last to formulas give precisely (15).
Step 4 With no loss of generality we assume that ψ¯ k is not the null function. Taking
bk =


(ψ¯ k + 2ψ¯ k∞)dν¯
−1
and ψˆ k = bk (ψ¯ k + 2ψ¯ k∞),
we then have

Slow Rates of Mixing for Dynamical Systems with Hyperbolic 519
Let φk represent the density of the measure λ¯ k with respect to m¯ . The next lemma shows
that φk ∈ F+
β , with the constant Cφk not depending on φk . This is enough for using Theorem 3.6 and conclude the proof of Theorem B; recall that we have taken k ≤ n/4.
Lemma 4.1 There is C > 0, not depending on φk , such that
|φk (x)¯ − φk (y)¯ | ≤ Cβs(¯ x,¯ y)¯ , for all x,¯ y¯ ∈ . ¯
Proof Since F¯ 2k
∗ ν¯ = ¯ν and ρ¯ = dν/d ¯ m¯ , we may write
ρ(¯ x)¯ = 	
Q∈Q¯ 2k
ρ(( ¯ F¯ 2k |Q)−1(x)) ¯
JF¯ 2k ((F¯ 2k |Q)−1(x)) ¯ . (17)
Recall that we have by definition
φk = dλ¯ k
dm = d
dm¯
F¯ 2k
∗ λˆ k and
dλˆ k
dm = ψˆ kρ.¯
Since ψˆ k is constant on elements of Q2k , we have

cQ
ρ(( ¯ F¯ 2k |Q)−1(x)) ¯
JF¯ 2k ((F¯ 2k |Q)−1(x)) ¯ ,
where cQ is constant on each Q ∈ Q¯ 2k . Hence,
φk (x)¯ − φk (y)¯ =

Fixing Q ∈ Q¯ 2k , let x¯

Since s(x¯

520 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
Recalling (17) and the fact that |cQ|≤ψˆ k∞ ≤ 3, it follows from (18), (19) and (20) that
there is some constant C > 0 not depending on φk such that
|φk (x)¯ − φk (y)¯ | ≤ Cβs(¯ x,¯ y)¯ .
Actually, we may take C = 3 ¯ρ∞(Cρ¯ + CF¯).
4.2 Central Limit Theorem
Let ϕ ∈ Hη and consider its lift to  defined as ϕ˜ = ϕ ◦ π. Similarly to what we have done
at the beginning of Sect. 4.1, we easily see that for proving Theorem C it is enough to obtain
the Central Limit Theorem for ϕ˜ with respect to ν on . As in the study of the correlations
decay, the proof uses results from the quotient dynamics F¯ : ¯ → ¯ . Let B¯ be the Borel
σ -algebra on ¯ . Define
B0 ={¯π−1
A¯ : A¯ ∈ B¯} and ϕ¯0 = Eν (ϕ˜ | B0).
Putting together the information from [10, Sect. 5.1.B] and Claim 1 in [10, Sect. 5.2] we
easily see that it is enough to show that
	
j≥0

|Pj (ϕ¯0ρ)¯ |dm <¯ ∞,
where P is the transfer operator associated to (F,¯ ν)¯ . The proof of the Sublemma in [10,
Sect. 5.2] gives that ϕ¯0 ∈ Fβ . Thus, if we consider λ¯ the measure whose density with respect
to m¯ is ϕ¯0ρ¯, then Pj (ϕ¯0ρ)¯ is by definition the density of Fj
∗ λ¯ with respect to m¯ . Hence, we
just have to show that

and consider λˆ the probability measure whose density with respect to m¯ is ϕˆ0ρ¯. We have

ϕˆ0d¯ν¯ =

ϕˆ0ρd¯ m¯ = 1. (21)
Recalling that

Here we construct a hyperbolic structure for the map g defined in Sect. 2.4 which satisfies
the assumptions of our main theorems. Concerning (P1)–(P4), we just have to show that (P1)
and (P4) hold, since (P2) and (P3) are trivially satisfied due to the uniform contraction of g in
the vertical direction and the skew-product form of g. We also need to give suitable estimates
for the decay of return times and the diameters in (2). The conclusions of Theorem D are
then a consequence of our main results.
The map g possesses an attractor in M which is precisely
 = 
n≥0
gn(M).
 is locally a product of an interval by a Cantor set. Topologically this set coincides with
the solenoid attractor for the classical case where f is taken uniformly expanding in S1.
For defining the hyperbolic structure we are going to construct a (mod 0) countable partition P0 of an interval I1 ⊂ S1 and associate to each element of P0 a suitable return time R∗
with respect to the map f . Then we take
 =  ∩ (I1 × D2
).
For each (x,y) ∈  we define γ s
(x,y) = {(x,y): y ∈ D2} and γ u(x,y) as the connected
component of  that contains (x,y). The s-subsets are precisely the sets  ∩(P × D2) with
P ∈ P0 and the return times are taken accordingly.
5.1 Partition and Return Times
Here we recall some objects and results from [11, Sect. 6] related to the map f . Let I1,...,Id
be the partition of S1 made by the fundamental domains of f arranged in a natural order,
and assume for definiteness that 0 is the common endpoint of I1 and Id . Letting x0 be the
other endpoint of I1 we define a sequence (xn)n in I1 with the property that f (xn+1) = xn
for n ≥ 0. Likewise, we consider x
0 the endpoint of Id distinct from 0 and define a sequence
(x
n)n in Id so that f (x
n+1) = x
n for n ≥ 0.
522 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
Let Jn = [xn+1,xn] and J 
n = [x
n,x
n+1] for n ≥ 0. Consider the (mod 0) partition of S1
A = {I2,...,Id−1}∪{Jn,J 
n; n ≥ 0}.
Let R = 1 on I2 ∪···∪ Id−1 ∪ J0 ∪ J 
0 and let R|Jn = R|J 
n = n + 1 for n ≥ 1. We have
f R(Ij ) = S1 for 2 ≤ j ≤ d − 1 and the f R images of all other elements of A are either
I1 ∪···∪Id−1 or I2 ∪···∪Id . The following results were proved in [11, Sects. 6.2 and 6.3]:
(1) Tail decay: Leb{R>n} ≈ n−1/γ ;
(2) Expansion: there is 0 <β< 1 such that (f R)
(x) ≥ β−1 for every x ∈ S1 \ {0};
(3) Bounded distortion: there is C > 0 such that for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n and x,y ∈ Jn
log (f i
)
(x)
(f i)
(y) ≤ C |f i
(x) − f i
(y)|
|Jn−i| .
This function R does not qualify as a return time for a hyperbolic structure of f satisfying
the Markov property. That role will be played by the function R∗ we introduce below. We
use the time function R to define a sequence of stopping times (Si)i as in (1). We also define
the sequence of return times
r1 = S1 = R, and ri+1 = Si+1 − Si, for i ≥ 1.
Using this sequence of stopping times we define the first return time R∗ to I1 as follows. We
simply take R∗(x) = Si(x), where i ≥ 1 is the minimum such that f Si(x) ∈ I1. As shown in
[11, Sect. 6.2] we have
Leb{R∗ > n}  n−1/γ . (22)
Let P0 be the Markov partition of I1 associated to R∗. Naturally associating the return
times to the s-subsets described above, then (22) gives the tail estimate that we need. Property (P4) is an easy consequence of the bounded distortion and expansion above, since the
estimates on the derivative of g in the unstable direction are given by f .
5.2 Diameter Estimate
Now we are going to show that δk  1/k1/γ , where δk is the quantity defined in (2). Taking
into account the uniform contraction on the stable direction, we just have to obtain the
desired control on the unstable one. We start by proving the following auxiliary result.
Lemma 5.1 Let X be an interval in S1 whose points have the same stopping times
S1,...,SN , for some N ≥ 1, with SN ≥ k, and such that f SN (X) = I1. Then |X|  1/k1/γ .
Proof Let r1,...,rN be the return times of points in X. Since we are assuming that SN =
r1 +···+ rN ≥ k, there must be some 1 ≤ m ≤ N such that rm ≥ k/N. Let
Y = f r1+···+rm−1 (X).
Considering the interval I ∈ A such that Y ⊂ I we have R|I = rm. Bounded distortion yields
|Y |  |f rm (Y)|
|f rm (I)|
· |I |.

On the other hand, the tail decay and expansion estimates give

|Y | and |f rm (Y)| ≤ βN−m|I1|.
Taking into account the choice of m we obtain

and so we are done.
Take P ∈ P0 and k ≥ 1. We consider the three possible cases of sets whose diameters
have to be controlled. The first two correspond to k ≤ R∗(P) − 1, and the last one corresponds to k>R∗(P) − 1; recall the definition of δk in Sect. 2.2.
Case 1 Assume first that k ≤ R∗(P) − 1 and 0 ≤ <R∗(P) − k. There is m ≥ 1 such that
R∗(P) = r1 +···+ rm. Considering r0 = 0, let 0 ≤ p<m be such that
r0 +···+ rp ≤ <r0 +···+ rp+1.
Letting  =  − (r0 +···+ rp), we have
 < rp+1 and  < rp+1 +···+ rm − k.
Now, if i + 1 = m, then
|f 
(P)|=|f 
(f r0+···+rp (P))|

Otherwise, for p + 1 < m we use Lemma 5.1 with X = f r0+···+rp+
(P), N = m − p, and
Sj = rp+1 +···+ rp+j − 
, for 1 ≤ j ≤ N,
thus obtaining
|f 
(P)|=|X|  1
k1/γ .
Observe that rp+1 −  is still a return time, which then implies that S1 is well defined.
Case 2. Assume now that k ≤ R∗(P)−1 and R∗(P)−k ≤  ≤ R∗(P)−1. We simply write
R∗ for R∗(P). Take Q ∈ Pk−R∗+1+ with Q ⊂ P . By construction, there is j ≥ 0 such that
points in f R∗
(Q) have the same stopping times S∗
1 ,...,S∗
j up to time k −R∗ +. Moreover,
f S∗
j+1 (f R∗
(Q)) = I1 and
S∗
j+1 ≥ k − R∗ + 1 + . (23)
There are integers m,n ≥ 1 and return times r1,...,rm+n such that
R∗ = r1 +···+ rm and S∗
j+1 = rm+1 +···+ rm+n. (24)
It follows from (23) and (24) that
<r1 +···+ rm+n − k.
524 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
Considering 0 ≤ p<m such that
r0 +···+ rp ≤ <r0 +···+ rp+1,
where r0 = 0 as before, and taking  =  − (r0 +···+ rp), we have
 < rp+1 and  < rp+1 +···+ rm+n − k.
The proof now follows as in the previous case.
Case 3. The case k > R(P) − 1 ≥  is treated as Case 2.
Appendix A: Mixing Rates for Tower Maps
The goal of this section is to prove Theorem 3.6. We follow the scheme of [11] with a
delicate control on the constants. The only exception is Appendix A.2.2 where we use results
from [4]. The setting will be the same of Sect. 3.3. For the sake of notational simplicity we
shall drop all bars.
Let λ and λ be probability measures in  whose densities with respect to m belong
to F+
β . Let
ϕ = dλ
dm
and ϕ = dλ
dm,
and consider Cϕ , Cϕ as in the definition of F+
β .
A.1 Main Estimates
Consider the product map F × F :  ×  →  × , and P = λ × λ the product measure
on  × . Let π, π :  ×  →  be the projections on the first and second coordinates
respectively. Note that Fn ◦ π = π ◦ (F × F)n. Consider the partition Q := {l,i} of , and
the partition Q × Q of  × . Note that each element of Q × Q is sent bijectively by F ×F
onto a union of elements of Q × Q. For each n ≥ 1, let
(Q × Q)n :=
n
−1
i=0
(F × F)−i
(Q × Q),
and let (Q × Q)n(x,x
) be the element of (Q × Q)n that contains (x,x
) ∈  × .
Since (F,ν) is mixing and the density of ν with respect to m belongs to L∞(m), we may
find n0 ∈ N and γ0 > 0 such that m(F −n(0) ∩ 0) ≥ γ0 for all n ≥ n0. Then we introduce
a sequence of stopping times 0 ≡ τ0 < τ1 < τ2 < ··· in  ×  given by
τ1(x,x
) = n0 + R(F ˆ n0 (x)),
τ2(x,x
) = τ1 + n0 + R(F ˆ τ1 (x
)),
τ3(x,x
) = τ2 + n0 + R(F ˆ τ2 (x)),
τ4(x,x
) = τ3 + n0 + R(F ˆ τ3 (x
)),
.
.
.
Slow Rates of Mixing for Dynamical Systems with Hyperbolic 525
with the falls to the ground level 0 alternating between x e x
. This implies that
τi+1 − τi ≥ n0 for all i ≥ 1. We define the simultaneous return time T :  ×  → N as
T (x,x
) = min
τi : (Fτi(x),Fτi(x
)) ∈ 0 × 0, with i ≥ 2

.
Note that we have T ≥ 2n0. Since (F,ν) is mixing, then (F × F,ν × ν) is ergodic, and so
T is well-defined m × m almost everywhere. Observe that if T (x,x
) = n, then
T |(Q×Q)n(x,x) ≡ n and (F × F)n((Q × Q)n(x,x
)) = 0 × 0.
Now we define a sequence ξ1 < ξ2 < ξ3 < ··· of partitions of  × . First we take
ξ1(x,x
) = (F −τ1(x)+1Q)(x) × . The partition ξ1 is formed by sets of the form  = A × 
where τ1 is constant on  and Fτ1 sends A bijectively to 0. For i > 1, if i if even (resp.
odd), we define ξi as the refinement of ξi−1 obtained by partitioning  ∈ ξi−1 in the x
direction (resp. x direction) into sets ˜ such that τi is constant on each ˜ and Fτi sends
π
()˜ (resp. π()˜ ) bijectively to 0. It will be useful to consider ξ0 = { × }. Let us
mention two useful properties about the measurability of the functions with respect to the
partitions defined above:
• τ1,τ2,...,τi are ξi-measurable for each i ≥ 1;
• {T = τi} and {T >τi} are ξi+1-measurable for each i ≥ 1.
This follows from the construction of the objects. Now we present the main estimates we
need on {τi} and T , whose proofs we postpone to Appendix A.3.
(E1) There is ε0 = ε0(Cϕ,Cϕ) > 0 such that P{T = τi | } ≥ ε0 for i ≥ 2 and  ∈ ξi with
T | >τi−1. The dependence of ε0 on Cϕ and Cϕ can be removed if we consider
i ≥ i0(Cϕ,Cϕ).
(E2) There is K0 = K0(Cϕ,Cϕ) > 0 such that P{τi+1 −τi > n0 +n | } ≤ K0m{R>n ˆ } for
i ≥ 0,  ∈ ξi and n ≥ 0. The dependence of K0 on Cϕ and Cϕ can be removed if we
consider i ≥ i0(Cϕ,Cϕ).
Let 0 ≡ T0 < T1 < T2 < ··· be stopping times in  ×  given by
T1 = T, and Tn = Tn−1 + T ◦ (F × F)Tn−1 , for n ≥ 2. (25)
(E3) There are K1 = K1(Cϕ,Cϕ) > 0 and ε1 > 0 (not depending on ϕ or ϕ
) such that

i=1(1 − ε1)i
P{Ti ≤ n<Ti+1} for n ≥ 1.
(E4) There is K2 = K2(Cϕ,Cϕ) > 0 such that P{Ti+1 − Ti > n} ≤ K2(m × m){T >n} for
i ≥ 0.
A.2 Convergence to the Equilibrium
We shall use (E1)–(E4) to prove Theorem 3.6. Let ν be the measure given by Theorem 3.5.
Observe that ν is a fixed point for F∗, whose density with respect to m belongs to F+
β . Theorem 3.6 follows just by taking λ = ν, once we obtain the upper bound for

decays at the same speed of P{T >n}. Consequently, we are left to estimate P{T >n}. At
this point we distinguish the polynomial and stretched exponential cases.
A.2.1 Polynomial Decay
Assume there are C > 0 and α > 1 such that m{R>n} ≤ Cn−α for all n ≥ 1. Then, there is
C >ˆ 0 (depending only on C and α) such that
m{R>n ˆ } =	
l>n
m{R>l} ≤ Cnˆ −α+1
. (27)
Recall that T ≥ 2n0 by construction. We write
P{T >n} = 	
1≤i<[ n
2n0 ]
P{T >n: τi ≤ n<τi+1} + P{T >n: τ[ n
2n0 ] ≤ n}. (28)
Since {T >τi−1} is ξi-measurable, conditioning on the elements of the partition ξi and using
(E1) it yields for i ≥ 2
P {T >τi | T >τi−1} = 1 − P {T = τi | T >τi−1} ≥ 1 − ε0. (29)

Since the dependence of ε0 on P can be removed if we consider i ≥ i0 for some i0 = i0(P),
we are left to compute the decay of
	
1≤i<[ n

P{T >n: τi ≤ n<τi+1}. (31)
For each i ≥ 1 we have P {T >n: τi ≤ n<τi+1} ≤ P {T >τi : n<τi+1}. As in (26) we
may show that
{T >τi : n<τi+1} ⊂ i

from estimate (E1) one gets
A ≤ (1 − ε0)
j−2
. (34)
Conditioning on ξk and using (E1), we have that each term in C is also bounded from above
by 1 − ε0, which then gives
C ≤ (1 − ε0)

where C0 is a constant depending only on K0, Cˆ, α and ε0. This yields the desired bound
for (31) in the polynomial case.
A.2.2 Stretched Exponential Decay
Assume that there are C,c > 0 and 0 < η ≤ 1 such that Leb{R>n} ≤ Ce−cnη
for all n ≥ 1.
Then there is C >ˆ 0 such that
m{R>n ˆ } =	
l>n
m{R>l} ≤ Ceˆ −cnη
.
The conclusion in this case is a consequence of (E1)–(E2) and the next lemma, which can
easily be obtained from [4, Lemma 4.2] by taking L = 1, τ = T , μ = P and tj = τj .
Slow Rates of Mixing for Dynamical Systems with Hyperbolic 529
Lemma A.1 Assume that there are ε0 > 0 and K0 > 0 such that for all i ≥ 2 and  ∈ ξi
with T | >τi−1 we have
(1) P{T = τi | } ≥ ε0;
(2) P{τi+1 − τi > n | } ≤ K0e−cnη
.
Then there exist C
,c > 0 such that P{T >n} ≤ C
e−c
nη
.
For the sake of completeness one must verify that the constants C and c obey the final
requirement of Theorem 3.6. Actually, it is proved in [4, Lemma 4.2] that there are a measurable function k and a measurable set Bn such that for q(n) = [αnη], with small α > 0,
we have {T >n}⊂{k > q(n)} ∪ Bn (recall estimate (27) in [4]) with P{k > q(n)} ≤
(1 − ε0)q(n), and for some positive integer K only depending on K0 and η,
P(Bn) ≤ 2q(n) 	
p≥n/2
Ce−cpη
, for n ≥ K.
Hence, taking α > 0 sufficiently small we obtain the desired conclusion.
A.3 Main Estimates
Here we obtain estimates (E1)–(E4). We start with some preliminary results on distortion
control that will enable us to prove (E1) and (E2).
Lemma A.2 There is C0 = C0(Cϕ) > 0 such that for every k ≥ 1 and A ∈ ∨k−1

Fk (A) = 0, we have for μ = Fk

dμ

≤ C0.
Moreover, the dependence of C0 on Cϕ can be removed if we assume that the number of
visits j ≤ k of A to 0 is bigger than some j0 = j0(Cϕ).
Proof Let x0,y0 ∈ A be such that Fk (x0) = x and Fk (y0) = y. Using (12) and the fact that
ϕ ∈ Fβ we have

where j is the number of visits of A to 0 prior to k.
The next result is proved in [11, Sublemma 1].
Lemma A.3 There is M0 > 0 such that dFn
∗ m
dm ≤ M0 for all n ≥ 1.
A.3.1 Proof of (E1)
Assume without loss of generality that i is even, and take  ∈ ξi as in the statement of (E1).
We have  = A×B with A,B ⊂ , where A is sent bijectively by Fτi−1 to 0 and Fτi−1 (B)
is contained in some l,j . At time τi we have Fτi(B) = 0 and Fτi(A) is spread over several
parts of {l : l ≤ τi − τi−1}. The set {T = τi} ∩  has the form A × B where A is the
530 J.F. Alves, V. Pinheiro
set of points in A which are sent to 0 by Fτi−1 and return to 0 by Fτi−τi−1 . Letting
μ = Fτi−1 ∗ (λ|A) we may write
P{T = τi | } = λ(A
)
λ(A) = μ(F −(τi−τi−1)
(0) ∩ 0)
μ(0) .
Note that Lemma A.2 applies to μ, thus giving
P{T = τi | } ≥ C−2
0
m(F −(τi−τi−1)
(0) ∩ 0)
m(0) .
Recall that n0 has been chosen in such a way that there is γ0 such that m(F −n(0) ∩ 0) ≥
γ0 > 0, for all n ≥ n0. By construction we have τi −τi−1 ≥ n0. This is enough for concluding
that there is some ε0 = ε0(Cϕ) > 0 for which P{T = τi | } ≥ ε0. The other case (i odd)
gives the dependence of ε0 also on Cϕ . These dependencies can be removed if we take i
large enough, according to Lemma A.2.

Using Lemma A.2 one has that dμ/dm∞ is bounded from above by some constant only

we take i large enough.
For obtaining (E3) and (E4) we consider the dynamical system Fˆ = (F ×F)T : × .
It follows from the definition of the sequence {Tn} in (25) that

define a separation time sˆ : ( × ) × ( × ) → N0 for Fˆ in the following way: given

The next result gives a distortion control similar to that of Lemma A.2.
Lemma A.6 There is C∗ = C∗(Cϕ,Cϕ) > 0 such that for any i ≥ 1 and any  ∈ ξˆ

This estimate is obviously true for i = 0. Take an arbitrary i ≥ 1 and  ∈ ξˆ

we have Ti+1 − Ti = T ◦ Fˆi

P{Ti+1 − Ti > n | } = Q{T >n}

Abstract. We show that a sectional-hyperbolic attracting set for a Hölder-C
1 vector field
admits finitely many physical/SRB measures whose ergodic basins cover Lebesgue almost
all points of the basin of topological attraction. In addition, these physical measures depend
continuously on the flow in the C
1
topology, that is, sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets
are statistically stable. To prove these results we show that each central-unstable disk in a
neighborhood of this class of attracting sets is eventually expanded to contain a ball whose
inner radius is uniformly bounded away from zero.

1. Introduction and statements of the results
The term statistical properties of a dynamical system refers to the statistical behavior
of typical trajectories of the system. It is well known that this relates to the properties
of the evolution of measures by the dynamics. Statistical properties are often a better
object of study than pointwise behavior. In fact, the future behavior of initial data can
be unpredictable, but statistical properties are often regular and their description simpler.
Arguably one of the most influential concepts in the theory of dynamical systems
has been the notion of physical (or Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen, SRB) measure. We say that an
invariant probability measure µ for a flow φt
is physical if the set
B(µ) =

z ∈ M : lim
t→∞


has non-zero volume, with respect to any volume form on the ambient compact manifold M. The set B(µ) is by definition the basin of µ. It is assumed that time averages of
these orbits are observable if the flow models a physical phenomenon.
The study of the existence of these special measures and their statistical properties for
uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and flows has a long and rich history, starting with
the works of Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen [17, 18, 47, 48, 52]. Some classes of systems that do
not satisfy all the basic assumptions of uniform hyperbolicity have much more recently
been shown to possess physical measures: sectional hyperbolicity is a generalization
of Smale’s notion of Axiom A [53] that allows for the inclusion of equilibria (also
known as singularities or steady states) and incorporates the classical Lorenz attractor
[29] as well as the geometric Lorenz attractors of [1, 24]. For three-dimensional flows,
sectional-hyperbolic attractors are precisely those that are robustly transitive, and they
reduce to Axiom A attractors when there are no equilibria [38].
For arbitrary dimensions this notion was established first in [32] and the first concrete
example provided by [15]. Sectional-hyperbolic attractors are those robustly transitive
attracting sets for which the flow is a star flow in the trapping region, that is, there are
no bifurcations of singularities or periodic orbits for all nearby dynamics (also known as
‘strongly homogeneous flow’). Again these sets reduce to Axiom A attractors if there are
no equilibria.
Sectional-hyperbolic attractors in 3-manifolds were shown to have a unique physical
measure in [7, 8] and sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets have finitely many ergodic
physical measures whose basins cover a full volume subset of a neighborhood of the
attracting set; see [9, 51]. The study of statistical properties of these measures is well
developed; among recent works are [3–6, 10, 12, 23, 25, 30, 50].
The existence of a unique physical measure for sectional-hyperbolic attractors for flows
in manifolds with any finite dimension was recently shown in [28] using the thermodynamical formalism and assuming certain properties of a stable foliation in a neighborhood of the attracting set, common to the above mentioned works in the three-dimensional
setting; see also [33] for a different proof using stochastic stability of such attractors.
Various issues regarding the existence and smoothness of the stable foliation in a
neighborhood of sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets are clarified in [4]; a topological
foliation always exists, and an analytic proof of smoothness of the foliation for the
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
2708 V. Araujo
classical Lorenz attractor (and nearby attractors) is given in [4, 6]. In [5] sufficient
conditions are provided for these foliations to have absolutely continuous holonomy maps,
a crucial technical feature to obtain many statistical properties in dynamics. For higher
differentiability properties of these foliations for geometric Lorenz attractors, see [54].
Here we pave the way to further study of statistical properties of sectional-hyperbolic
attracting sets. We solve the basin problem for sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets, that
is, we show that an open dense and full measure subset of points in a neighborhood
of these sets is exponentially asymptotic to some orbit inside the set. More precisely,
given a neighborhood U of an invariant sectional-hyperbolic attracting set 3 of a smooth
flow φt
, there exist K, λ > 0 and an open and dense subset W ⊂ U with full Lebesgue
measure (Leb(U\W) = 0) such that for any given y ∈ W there exists x ∈ 3 satisfying
d(φty, φtx) ≤ Ke−λt for all t > 0.
Moreover, coupled with recent results from [20] on weak limits of time averages for
almost all orbits in partially hyperbolic sets with applications to sectional-hyperbolic
attracting sets, we complement [28] proving the existence of finitely many ergodic physical
measures for sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets in any dimension. In addition, the basins
of these measures cover a full Lebesgue measure subset of a neighborhood of the
sectional-hyperbolic attracting set.
With this in hand, we use recent results from [40] on robust entropy expansiveness for
sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets to prove that the physical measures depend continuously on the flow, showing that asymptotic time averages for Lebesgue almost all points in a
neighborhood of such attracting sets are robust under small perturbations of the dynamics.
This is known as statistical stability and our proof provides a far-reaching extension of the
results already obtained for the 3-flows having geometric Lorenz attractors in [2] and the
classical Lorenz attractor in [11].
1.1. Preliminary definitions. Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold with induced
distance d and volume form Leb. Let X
1
(M) be the set of C
1 vector fields on M and
denote by φ
G
t
the flow generated by G ∈ X
1
(M). We say that G is Hölder-C
1
if on any
local chart the derivative DG is α-Hölder for some fixed 0 < α < 1. We write X
1+(M)
for the vector space of all Hölder-C
1 vector fields over M.
Given a compact invariant set 3 for G ∈ X
1
(M), we say that 3 is isolated if there exists
an open set U ⊃ 3 such that 3 =
T
t∈R φt(U). If U can be chosen so that
Closure (ϕt(U)) ⊂ U for all t > 0,
then we say that 3 is an attracting set.
A compact invariant set 3 is partially hyperbolic if the tangent bundle over 3 can be
written as a continuous Dφt-invariant sum T3M = E
s ⊕ E
cu, where ds = dim E
s
x ≥ 1
and dcu = dim E
cu
x ≥ 2 for x ∈ 3, and there exist constants C > 0, λ ∈ (0, 1) such that
for all x ∈ 3, t ≥ 0, we have:
• uniform contraction along E
s
(kDφt
|E
s
x
k ≤ Cλt
); and
• domination of the splitting (kDφt
|E
s
x
k · kDφ−t
|E
cu
φt x
k ≤ Cλt
).
We say that E
s
is the stable bundle and E
cu the center-unstable bundle. A partially
hyperbolic attracting set is a partially hyperbolic set that is also an attracting set.
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2709
We say that the center-unstable bundle E
cu is sectional expanding if for every
two-dimensional subspace Px ⊂ E
cu
x
,
|det(Dφt(x) | Px )| ≥ Keθt for all x ∈ 3, t ≥ 0. (1.1)
If σ ∈ M and G(σ) = 0, then σ is called an equilibrium or singularity in what follows,
and we denote by Sing(G) the family of all such points. An invariant set is non-trivial if it
is neither a periodic orbit nor an equilibrium.
We say that a compact invariant set 3 is a sectional-hyperbolic set if 3 is partially
hyperbolic with sectional expanding center-unstable bundle and all equilibria in 3
are hyperbolic. A sectional-hyperbolic set which is also an attracting set is called a
sectional-hyperbolic attracting set.
A singular-hyperbolic set is a compact invariant set 3 which is partially hyperbolic
with volume expanding center-unstable subbundle and all equilibria within the set are
hyperbolic. A sectional-hyperbolic set is singular-hyperbolic and both notions coincide
if, and only if, dcu = 2.
Remark 1.1
(1) A sectional-hyperbolic set with no equilibria is necessarily a hyperbolic set, that
is, the center-unstable subbundle admits a splitting E
cu
x = R{G(x)} ⊕ E
u
x
for all
x ∈ 3 where E
u
x
is uniformly contracting under the time reversed flow; see, for
example, [7].
(2) A sectional-hyperbolic attracting set cannot contain isolated periodic orbits. For
otherwise such orbit must be a periodic sink, contradicting volume expansion.
We recall that a subset 3 ⊂ M is transitive if it has a full dense orbit, that is, there exists
x ∈ 3 such that Closure{φtx : t ≥ 0} = 3 = Closure{φtx : t ≤ 0}.
A non-trivial transitive sectional-hyperbolic attracting set is a sectional-hyperbolic
attractor. For more details on these notions, see, for example, [7] and references therein.
1.2. Statement of the results. The definition of singular hyperbolicity ensures that
every invariant probability measure supported in a singular-hyperbolic set is a hyperbolic
measure. Moreover, if the vector field is smooth (at least Hölder-C
1
), from the proof
of [8, Theorem B, §4] or explicitly from [51, Theorem 1.5] we get that every singularhyperbolic attracting set admits finitely many µ1, . . . , µk ergodic physical/SRB invariant measures; and the union of the ergodic basins of these measures covers a full
Lebesgue measure subset of the topological basin of attraction of 3 (i.e. Leb (U\
Sk
i=1
B(µi)) = 0).
We show here that the same result is true in higher dimensions for sectional-hyperbolic
attracting sets.
THEOREM A. Every sectional-hyperbolic attracting set for a Hölder-C
1
vector field
admits finitely many µ1, . . . , µk ergodic physical/SRB invariant probability measures.
Moreover, the union of the ergodic basins of these measures covers a full Lebesgue measure
subset of the topological basin of attraction of 3.

In [28] existence and uniqueness of the physical measure were obtained for
sectional-hyperbolic attractors of C
2 vector fields. We extend the argument from [28],
avoiding the use of a dense orbit, taking advantage of the recent results from [20] which
hold in the C
1+ topology.
By robustness of partial hyperbolicity and sectional expansion, given a sectionalhyperbolic attracting set 3G(U) =
T
t>0 φt(U) with trapping region U, there exists
a neighborhood U ⊂ X
1+(M) of G such that U is a trapping region and 3Y (U) is
sectional-hyperbolic for all Y ∈ U. It is then natural to study the stability of the physical
measures under small perturbation of the vector field G.
THEOREM B. Let G ∈ X
1+(M) be a vector field with a trapping region U whose attracting set 3G(U) =
T
t>0 φt(U) is sectional-hyperbolic. Then there exists a neighborhood
U ⊂ X
1+(M) of G such that, for each choice of Gn ∈ U and µn physical measures for
Gn supported in U such that kGn − GkC1 → 0 when n ր ∞, each weak∗ accumulation
point µ of (µn)n≥1 is a linear convex combination of the ergodic physical measures of 3G
provided in Theorem A:
µ ∈ 8(G) =

.
In other words, the convex hull 8(G) of the ergodic physical measures of a
sectional-hyperbolic attracting set depends continuously on the vector field, with respect
to the C
1
topology of vector fields and weak∗
topology of probability measures on a
manifold.
Statistical stability means that time averages ψ˜ G = limt→∞(1/t) R t
0 ψ ◦ φ
G
s
ds of continuous observables ϕ : U → R, in a neighborhood of the sectional-hyperbolic attracting
sets, are well defined Lebesgue almost everywhere in U, depend continuously on the vector
field G generating the flow φ
G
t
, so that we can ensure that |ψ˜ G − ψ˜ G′
| is small as long has
kG − G′kC1 is small enough.
Theorem B improves both [2] and [11] since, although not dealing with the density of
the invariant probability of the quotient map along stable leaves on a global cross-section
of the geometric Lorenz attractor, its statement and proof apply to a much larger family of
sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets.
In particular, the attracting sets appearing as small perturbations of singular-hyperbolic
attractors as in Morales [36], which must have a singular component, are statistical stable
whatever the number of singularities involved.
We note that there are many examples of singular-hyperbolic attracting sets,
non-transitive and containing non-Lorenz-like singularities; see Figure 1 for an example
obtained by conveniently modifying the geometric Lorenz construction, and many others
in [37]. Statistical stability follows for all these examples.
Moreover, Theorem B applies to the multidimensional Lorenz attractor described in
[15] without further ado.
In addition, the open families of Lorenz-like attractors obtained after bifurcating saddle
connections by many authors [21, 27, 34, 35, 39, 44–46, 49] are automatically endowed
with statistical stability after Theorem B, that is, in the (generic) unfolding of double

sets indicated by H1, H2 above) and containing non-Lorenz like singularities.
(resonant) homoclinic cycle or saddle connections, the physical measure for the ensuing
Lorenz-like attractors depends continuously on the parameters.
We mention that in the preprint [33] the authors prove stochastic stability for C
2
transitive sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets which, in particular, provides an alternative
proof of the existence of a unique SRB measure for C
2
sectional-hyperbolic attractors.
This is a different kind of stability which is in general unrelated to statistical stability.
Whereas statistical stability compares the SRB measures of close vector fields, stochastic
stability considers random perturbations of a given vector field, usually though a diffusion,
and checks whether the stationary measure for the randomly perturbed vector field
converges to some special invariant measure for the original unperturbed vector field when
the size of the diffusion vanishes. The results strongly depend on the type of random
perturbation chosen; see, for example, [14, Appendix D].
The proofs of Theorems A and B use a construction of adapted cross-sections, generalizing that presented in the 3-flow setting in [8] and in the codimension 2 setting in [5],
which has been used to prove many delicate statistical properties of these flows; a similar
construction (but built in a different way) of higher-dimensional adapted cross-sections was
recently proposed in [19]. This enables us to solve the basin problem as follows; see, for
example, [13] for a similar but more delicate instance in a highly non-uniformly hyperbolic
setting.
For a periodic point p of G we write O(p) for its compact orbit {φtp : t ∈ R} = {φtp :
t ∈ [0, Tp]} where the minimal Tp > 0 satisfying this is the period of any point q ∈ O(p).
Moreover, we write
Ws
x = {y ∈ M : d(φty, φtx) −−−−→ t→+∞
0}
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press

for the stable manifold of x ∈ M, and for a given ε0 > 0 we write
Wu
x
(ε0) = {y ∈ M : d(φ−ty, φ−tx) ≤ ε0, ∀t ≥ 0}
for the local unstable manifold of x of size ε0. There are analogous and dual notions of
local stable manifolds and unstable manifolds.
We say that a periodic point p is hyperbolic if DφTp
(p) : TpM 	 admits three
DφTp
-invariant subspaces forming a splitting TpM = E
s
p ⊕ hGi ⊕ E
u
p
, where hGi =
R · G is an eigenspace with eigenvalue 1, E
s
p
is contracted and E
u
p
expanded. The
(un)stable manifold theorem ensures that Wu
q
(ε0) is an embedded manifold with
TqWu
q
(ε0) = E
u
q
and Ws
q
is an immersed submanifold with TqWs
q = E
s
q
, for each
q ∈ O(p). We write Wu
O(pi)
(ε0) for the union S
{Wu
q
(ε0) : q ∈ O(p)} and analogously
Ws
O(pi) =
S
{Ws
q
(ε0) : q ∈ O(p)}. For more details on these notions from hyperbolic
dynamics, see, for example, [41].
THEOREM C. Let G ∈ X
1
(M) be a vector field with a trapping region U whose attracting
set 3 =
T
t>0 φt(U) is sectional-hyperbolic. Then there are ε0 > 0 and finitely many
(hyperbolic) periodic points p1, . . . , pl of 3 such that
Wcs = {Ws
x
: x ∈ Wu
O(pi)
(ε0); i = 1, . . . , l}
is open and dense in U = {y ∈ M : d(φty, 3) −−−−→ t→+∞
0} ⊃ U. In particular, S
i Ws
O(pi)
is dense in U.
In addition, if G ∈ X
1+(M), then Wcs contains the basin of any physical probability
measure supported in 3 and has full volume: Leb(U\Wcs) = 0.
Recently [56] obtained a similar structure for C
2
sectional-hyperbolic attractors,
showing that they are homoclinic classes.
We conjecture that in this setting Wsc is the entire basin, as follows.
Conjecture 1. For any sectional-hyperbolic attracting set 3 the topological basin of
attraction coincides with the family of stable manifolds through the points of local unstable
leaves of finitely many periodic orbits, that is, U = Wcs
.
The following example shows that partially hyperbolic attracting sets which are not
sectional-hyperbolic do not necessarily satisfy the conclusions of Theorem C.
Example 1. (Bowen’s example flow; see [55] for the not very clear reason for the
name) This is a folklore example showing that Birkhoff averages need not exist almost
everywhere. Indeed, in the system pictured in Figure 2 time averages only exist for the
sources s3, s4 and for the set of separatrixes and saddle equilibria 3 = W1 ∪ W2 ∪ W3 ∪
W4 ∪ {s1, s2}, which is an attracting set.
The orbit under this flow φt of every point z ∈ S
1 × [−1, 1] = M not in 3 ∪ {s3, s4}
accumulates on either side of the separatrixes, as suggested in the figure, if we impose the
condition λ

on the eigenvalues of the saddle fixed points s1 and s2; for more
specifics on this, see, for example, [55] and references therein.

Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2713
FIGURE 2. A sketch of Bowen’s example flow.
Due to the very long sojourn times around s1 and s2, future time averages of continuous
functions ϕ : M → R with ϕ(s1) 6= ϕ(s2) do not exist; see, for example, [26]. However,
time averages do exist for points in 3 ∪ {s3, s4}.
Hence, no point in M\(3 ∪ {s3, s4}) belongs to the stable manifold of any point of 3.
That is, we have that Ws
(3) = M\(3 ∪ {s3, s4}) but the union of the stable manifolds of
the points of 3 is simply 3.
To obtain an example with Lorenz-like singularities, just multiply this system by the
north–south flow on S
1
so that the derivative of the flow at the sink in the south pole S has
an eigenvalue λ < 0 so that λ
+
i + λ > 0, i = 1, 2; and then take the attracting set 3 × {S}
in M × S

.
1.3. Organization of the text. In §2 we present precise statements of the main properties
of sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets together with a precise description of the construction of a family of adapted cross-sections 4 and a corresponding piecewise smooth and
uniformly hyperbolic global Poincaré return map (with singularities) on a subset 4′′ of 4,
which might be of independent interest for further work on statistical properties of these
systems.
In §3 we consider the basin of a C
1
sectional-hyperbolic attracting set 3 proving the
topological part of the statement of Theorem C as a consequence of showing that every
center-unstable disk contains subdisks which are sent, by arbitrarily large iterates of the
Poincaré map, to center-unstable disks with inner radius uniformly bounded away from
zero, accumulating the local unstable manifold of a hyperbolic periodic orbit, from a finite
subset of such orbits in the attracting set. In §4.1 we obtain as a consequence of the previous
result that every positively invariant subset of 3 containing Leb-almost every (a.e.) point
of a center-unstable disk must contain a center-unstable disk with uniform inner radius.
This enables us to complete the proof of Theorem A in §4.2 by using and completing
the relevant steps presented in [28] together with the results from §4.1 and the more recent
results from [20], under the assumption that the vector field is Hölder-C
1
. Following this,
a proof of the measure-theoretic part of the statement of Theorem C is presented in §4.3.

Finally, we present a proof of Theorem B on statistical stability in §5, coupling the
previous results with robust entropy expansiveness of sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets
obtained in [40].
2. Preliminary results on sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets
Let G be a C
1 vector field admitting a singular-hyperbolic attracting set 3 with isolating
neighborhood U. Given x ∈ M, we denote the omega-limit set
ω(x) = ωG(x) =

y ∈ M : ∃tn ր ∞ s.t. φtn
x −−−→ n→∞
y
	
and the alpha-limit set α(x) = ω−G(x) which are non-empty on a compact ambient
space M.
2.1. Lorenz-like singularities. We first recall some properties of sectional-hyperbolic
attracting sets, extending some results from [4, 5] which hold for dcu ≥ 2.
PROPOSITION 2.1. Let 3 be a sectional-hyperbolic attracting set and let σ ∈ 3 be an
equilibrium. If there exists x ∈ 3\{σ} such that σ ∈ ω(x) ∪ α(x), then σ is generalized Lorenz-like: that is, DG(σ)|E
cu
σ
has a real eigenvalue λ
s and λ
u = inf{Re(λ) :
λ ∈ sp(DG(σ)), Re(λ) ≥ 0} satisfies −λ
u < λs < 0 < λu and so the index of σ is
dim E
s
σ = ds + 1.
Remark 2.2
(1) If σ ∈ Sing(G) ∩ 3 is a generalized Lorenz-like singularity and γ
s
σ
is its local
stable manifold, then Twγ
s
σ = E
cs
w = E
s
w ⊕ R · {G(w)} at w ∈ γ
s
σ
\{σ} since T γ s
σ
is Dφt-invariant and contains G(w) (because γ
s
σ
is φt-invariant) and the dimensions
coincide.
(2) If an equilibrium σ ∈ Sing(G) ∩ 3 is not generalized Lorenz-like, then σ is not in
the limit set of 3\{σ},that is, there is no x ∈ 3\{σ} such that σ ∈ α(x) ∪ ω(x).
An example is provided by the pair of equilibria of the Lorenz system of equations
away from the origin: these are saddles with an expanding complex eigenvalue which
belong to the attracting set of the trapping ellipsoid already known to E. Lorenz; see,
for example, [7, §3.3] and references therein.
Proof of Proposition 2.1. It follows from sectional hyperbolicity that σ is a hyperbolic
saddle and that at most dcu eigenvalues have positive real part. If there are only dcu − 1
such eigenvalues, then the constraints on λ
s
and λ
u
follow from sectional expansion.
Let γ be the local stable manifold for σ. If σ ∈ ω(x) ∩ α(x) for some x ∈ 3\{x}, it
remains to rule out the case dim γ = d − dcu = ds
.
In this case, Tpγ = E
s
p
for all p ∈ γ ∩ 3 and, in particular, G(p) ∈ E
s
p
. On the one
hand, G(p) ∈ E
cu
p
(see, for example, [7, Lemma 6.1]), so we deduce that G(p) = 0 for all
p ∈ γ ∩ 3 and so γ ∩ 3 = {σ}.
On the other hand, if σ ∈ ω(x) (the case σ ∈ α(x) is analogous), then by the local
behavior of orbits near hyperbolic saddles, there exists p ∈ (γ \{σ}) ∩ ω(x) ⊂ (γ \{σ}) ∩
3 which, as we have seen, is impossible.

2.2. Extension of the stable bundle and center-unstable cone fields. Let Dk denote the
k-dimensional open unit disk and let Embr
(Dk
, M) denote the set of C
r
embeddings
ψ : Dk → M endowed with the C
r distance. We say that the image of any such embedding
is a C
r
k-dimensional disk.
PROPOSITION 2.3 [4, Proposition 3.2, Theorem 4.2 and Lemma 4.8]. Let 3 be a partially
hyperbolic attracting set.
(1) The stable bundle E
s over 3 extends to a continuous uniformly contracting
Dφt-invariant bundle E
s on an open positively invariant neighborhood U0 of 3.
(2) There exists a constant λ ∈ (0, 1), such that the following statements hold.
(a) For every point x ∈ U0 there is a C
r
embedded ds-dimensional disk Ws
x ⊂ M,
with x ∈ Ws
x
, such that TxWs
x = E
s
x
, φt(Ws
x
) ⊂ Ws
φt x
and d(φtx, φty) ≤
λ
td(x, y) for all y ∈ Ws
x
, t ≥ 0 and n ≥ 1.
(b) The disks Ws
x
depend continuously on x in the C
0
topology: there is a continuous map γ : U0 → Emb0
(Dds
, M) such that γ(x)(0) = x and γ(x)(Dds ) =
Ws
x
. Moreover, there exists L > 0 such that Lip γ(x) ≤ L for all x ∈ U0.
(c) The family of disks F
s = {Ws
x
: x ∈ U0} defines a topological foliation Ws of
U0: every x0 ∈ U0 admits a neighborhood V ⊂ U0 and a homeomorphism ψ :
V → R
ds × R
dcu so that ψ(Ws
x
) = π
−1
s
{πs(ψ(x))} where π
s
: R
ds × R
dcu →
R
ds
is the canonical projection.
Remark 2.4. For any two close enough dcu-disks D1, D2 contained in U0 and transverse
to F
s
there exists an open subset Dˆ
1 of D1 such that Ws
x ∩ D2 is a singleton. This defines
the holonomy map h : Dˆ
1 → D2, Dˆ
1 ∋ x 7→ Ws
x ∩ D2 and Proposition 2.3 ensures that h
is continuous.
The splitting T3M = E
s ⊕ E
cu extends continuously to a splitting TU0M = E
s ⊕ E
cu
where E
s
is the invariant uniformly contracting bundle in Proposition 2.3 (however, E
cu
is not invariant in general). Given a > 0 and x ∈ U0, we define the center-unstable cone
field as C
cu
x
(a) = {v = v
s + v
cu ∈ E
s
x ⊕ E
cu
x
: kv
sk ≤ akv
cuk}.
PROPOSITION 2.5. Let 3 be a partially hyperbolic attracting set.
(1) There exists T0 > 0 such that for any a > 0, after possibly shrinking U0,
Dφt
· C
cu
x
(a) ⊂ C
cu
φt x
(a) for all t ≥ T0, x ∈ U0.
(2) Let λ1 ∈ (0, 1) be given. After possibly increasing T0 and shrinking U0, there
exist constants K, θ > 0 such that |det(Dφt
|Px )| ≥ K eθt for each two-dimensional
subspace Px ⊂ E
cu
x
and all x ∈ U0, t ≥ 0.
Proof. For item (1) see [4, Proposition 3.1]. Item (2) follows from the robustness of
sectional expansion; see [5, Proposition 2.10] with straightforward adaptation to area
expansion along any two-dimensional subspace of E
cu
x
.
2.3. Global Poincaré map on adapted cross-sections. We assume that 3 is a partially
hyperbolic attracting set and recall how to construct a piecewise smooth Poincaré map
f : 4 → 4 preserving a contracting stable foliation Ws
(4). This largely follows [8] (see
also [7, Ch. 6]) and [5, §3] with slight modifications to account for the higher-dimensional
setup.

We write ρ0 > 0 for the injectivity radius of the exponential map expz
: TzM → M
for all z ∈ U, so that expz
| Bz(0, ρ0) : Bz(0, ρ0) → M, v 7→ expz
v is a diffeomorphism
with Bz(0, ρ0) = {v ∈ TzM : kvk ≤ ρ0} and D expz
(0) = Id and also d(z, expz
(v)) =
kvk for all v ∈ Bz(0, ρ0).
2.3.1. Construction of a global adapted cross-section. Let y ∈ 3 be a regular point
(G(y) 6= 0). Then there exists an open flow box E Vy ⊂ U0 containing y. That is, if we
fix ε0 ∈ (0, 1) small, then we can find a diffeomorphism χ : Dd−1 × (−ε0, ε0) → Vy
with χ(0, 0) = y such that χ
−1 ◦ φt ◦ χ(z, s) = (z, s + t). Define the cross-section 6y =
χ(Dd−1 × {0}).
Remark 2.6. We assume that 6y ⊂ expy
(By (0, ρ0/3) ∩ G(z)⊥) and kD(expy
)
−1
x
k ≤ 2
for all x ∈ 6y without loss of generality.
For each x ∈ 6y, let Ws
x
(6y ) =
S
|t|<ε0
φt(Ws
x
) ∩ 6y . This defines a topological
foliation Ws
(6y ) of 6y . We can also assume that 6y is diffeomorphic to Ddcu−1 × Dds
by reducing the size of the 6y if needed. The stable boundary ∂
s6y
∼= ∂Ddcu−1 × Dds ∼=
S
dcu−2 × Dds
is a regular topological manifold homeomorphic to a cylinder of stable
leaves, since Ws
is a topological foliation; that is, ∼= denotes only the existence of a
homeomorphism, and the subspace topology of ∂
s6y induced by M coincides with the
manifold topology.
Let D
ds
a denote the open disk of radius a ∈ (0, 1] in R
ds
. Define the sub-cross-section
6y (a) ∼= D
dcu−1
a × D
ds
a , and the corresponding sub-flow box Vy (a) ∼= 6y(a) × (−ε0, ε0)
consisting of trajectories in Vy which pass through 6y (a). In what follows we fix
a0 = 3/4.
For each equilibrium σ ∈ 3, we let Vσ be an open neighborhood of σ on which the flow
is locally conjugated by a homeomorphism to a linear flow (Hartman–Grobman theorem).
Let γ
s
σ
and γ
u
σ
denote the local stable and unstable manifolds of σ within Vσ ; trajectories
starting in Vσ remain in Vσ for all future time if and only if they lie in γ
s
σ
.
Define V0 =
S
σ∈Sing(G)∩U Vσ . We shrink the neighborhoods Vσ so that they are
disjoint, 3 6⊂ V0, and γ
u
σ ∩ ∂Vσ ⊂ Vy (a0) for some regular point y = y(σ).
By compactness of 3, there exist ℓ ∈ Z
+ and regular points y1, . . . , yℓ ∈ 3 such that
3\V0 ⊂
Sℓ
j=1 Vyj
(a0). We enlarge the set {yj } to include the points y(σ) mentioned
above, adjust the positions of the cross-sections 6yj
if necessary to ensure that they
are disjoint, and define the global cross-section 4 =
Sℓ
j=1 6yj
and its smaller version
4(a) =
Sℓ
j=1 6yj
(a) for each a ∈ (0, 1).
In what follows we modify the choices of U0 and T0. However, Vyj
, 6yj
and 4 remain
unchanged from now on and correspond to our current choice of U0 and T0. All subsequent
choices will be labeled U1 ⊂ U0 and T1 ≥ T0. In particular, U1 ⊂ V0 ∪
Sℓ
j=1 Vyj
(a0). We
set δ0 = d(∂4, ∂4(a0)) > 0 where ∂4(a) is the boundary of the submanifold 4(a) of M,
a ∈ (0, 1], and 4 = 4(1).
2.3.2. The Poincaré map. By Proposition 2.3, for any δ > 0 we can choose T1 ≥ T0
such that diam φt(Ws
x
(6yj
)) < δ, for all x ∈ 6yj
, j = 1, . . . , ℓ and t > T1. We fix

Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2717
T1 = T1(δ0) for δ = δ0 = d(∂4, ∂4(a0)) in what follows and define Ŵ0 = {x ∈ 4 :
φT1+1(x) ∈
S
σ∈Sing(G)∩U0
(γ s
σ
\{σ})} and 4′ = 4\Ŵ0. If x ∈ 4′
, then φT1+1(x) cannot
remain inside V0 so there exist t > T1 + 1 and j = 1, . . . , ℓ such that φtx ∈ Vyj
(a0).
Since ε0 < 1, there exists t > T1 such that φtx ∈ 6yj
(a0).
For each 6 = 6yj ∈ 4, we choose a center-unstable disk W6 which crosses 6 and is
transversal to Ws
(6), that is, every stable leaf Ws
x
(6) intersects W6 transversely at only
one point, for each x ∈ 6. Then, for every given x ∈ W6 ∩ 4′
, we define
f (x) = φτ(x)(x) where τ(x) = inf 
t > T1 : φtx ∈
[
ℓ
j=1
Closure 6yj
(a0)

. (2.1)
We note that by the choice of T1 = T1(δ0) we have diam φτ(x)(Ws
x
(6)) < δ0 and so the
disk φτ(x)(Ws
x
(6)), although not necessarily contained in any 6yj
, is certainly contained
in some Vyj
by construction. Thus we can define
f (y) = φτ(y)(y) where τ(y) = inf 
t > T1 : φty ∈
[
ℓ
j=1
6yj

(2.2)
for each y ∈ Ws
x
(6). This defines τ and f on 4′
.
We define the topological foliation Ws
(4) =
Sℓ
j=1 Ws
(6yj
) of 4 with leaves Ws
x
(4)
passing through each x ∈ 4. From the uniform contraction of stable leaves together with
the choice of δ0, T1(δ0) and the definition of Ws
(4) and flow invariance of Ws we obtain
the following proposition.
PROPOSITION 2.7 [5, Proposition 3.4]. For large enough T1 > T0, f (Ws
x
(4)) ⊂ Ws
f x (4)
for all x ∈ 4′
.
Remark 2.8 The definition of τ in [5] is pointwise, namely, τ(x) = inf{t > T1 : φtx ∈
Sℓ
j=1 Closure 6yj
(a0)}, and this allows discontinuities of the return time and return
map along stable leaves, that is, a pair of indexes i 6= j and of close points w, z ∈ Ws
x
so that φτ(w)(w) ∈ Closure 6yj
(a0) and φτ(z)(z) ∈ Closure 6yi
(a0). So the statement of
[5, Proposition 3.4] (which is analogous to Proposition 2.7 with dcu = 2) does not make
sense in this setup, since we would have f (Ws
x
) with elements in distinct cross-sections.
The definition of τ first on the points of a fixed collection of center-unstable leaves
(2.1), and then the smooth extension to the stable leaves through each of these points (2.2),
provides for the crucial property stated in Proposition 2.7.
The rest of the features of the global Poincaré map f stated and used in [4, 5, 9] remain
valid with the same proofs.
In this way we obtain a piecewise C
r global Poincaré map f : 4′ → 4 =
Sℓ
j=1 6j (a0)
with piecewise C
r
roof function τ : 4′ → [T1, ∞), and deduce the following standard
result.
LEMMA 2.9 [5, Lemma 3.2]. If 6y contains no equilibria (i.e. Ŵ0 ∩ 6y = ∅), then
τ | 6y ≤ T1 + 2. In general, there is C > 0 such that τ(x) ≤ −C log dist(x, Ŵ0) for all
x ∈ 4′
; in particular, τ(x) → ∞ as dist(x, Ŵ0) → 0.

We define ∂
s4(a0) =
Sℓ
j=1
∂
s6yj
(a0) and Ŵ1 = {x ∈ 4′
: f x ∈ ∂
s4(a0)} and then
set Ŵ = Ŵ0 ∪ Ŵ1. Clearly Ŵ0 ∩ Ŵ1 = ∅.
LEMMA 2.10
(1) Ŵ0 is a ds-submanifold of 4 given by a finite union of stable leaves Wsi
(4), i =
1, . . . , k; and
(2) Ŵ1 is a regular embedded (d − 2)-topological submanifold foliated by stable leaves
from Ws
(4) with finitely many connected components.
Remark 2.11. Note that Ŵ0 is a (smooth) submanifold of 4 with codimension dcu − 1, so it
separates 4 only if dcu = 2; while Ŵ1 is a regular topological codimension 1 submanifold
of 4 and so it separates 4.
Proof. It is clear that Ws
x
(4) ⊂ Ŵ for all x ∈ Ŵ, so Ŵ is foliated by stable leaves. We claim
that Ŵ is precisely the set of those points of 4 which are sent to the boundary of 4 or never
visit 4 in the future.
Indeed, if x0 ∈ 4′\Ŵ1, then f x0 = φτ(x0)(x0) ∈ 6′
for some 6′ ∈ 4(a0) = {6yj
(a0)}.
For x close to x0, it follows from continuity of the flow that f x ∈ 6′
(with τ(x) close to
τ(x0)). Hence x ∈ 4′\Ŵ1 and, since 4′ = 4\Ŵ0, the claim is proved and, moreover, Ŵ is
closed.
For item (1), we note that Ŵ0 ⊂ 4 ∩ φ
−1
[0,T1+1](
S
σ
γ
s
σ
) and we may assume without
loss of generality that the above union comprises only generalized Lorenz-like equilibria;
cf. Remark 2.2(2). Hence Twγ
s
σ = E
cs
w for w ∈ γ
s
σ
\{σ}; see Remark 2.2(1). Thus Ŵ0 is
contained in the transversal intersection between a compact (ds + 1)-submanifold and a
compact (d − 1)-manifold, so Ŵ0 is a compact differentiable ds-submanifold of M and 4.
In addition, since Ŵ0 is foliated by stable leaves which are ds-dimensional, Ŵ0 has only
finitely many connected components in 4.
For item (2), note that for each x ∈ Ŵ1 we have that f x ∈ ∂6j (a0) ⊂ 6j . Thus there
exists a neighborhood Wx of x in 4 and Vf x of f x in 6j such that f | Wx : Wx → Vf x is
a diffeomorphism. Hence Ŵ1 ∩ Wx = (f | Wx )
−1
(Vx ∩ ∂
s6(a0)) is homeomorphic to a
(dcu − 2 + ds)-dimensional disk. Moreover, this shows that the topology of Ŵ1 is the same
as the subspace topology induced by the topology of 4. We conclude that Ŵ1 is a regular
topological (d − 2)-dimensional submanifold.
It remains to rule out the possibility of existence of infinitely many connected
components Ŵ
m
1
, m ∈ Z
+, of Ŵ1 in 4. Since 4 contains finitely many sections only, there
exist cross-sections 6j , 6i
in 4 and, taking a subsequence if necessary, an accumulation
set Ŵ˜ = limm Ŵ
m
1 within Closure(6j ) so that f (Ŵm
1
) ⊂ ∂
s6i(a0) for all m ≥ 1. By the
continuity of the stable foliation, Ŵ˜ is a union of stable leaves.
We claim that the Poincaré times τ(xm) for xm ∈ Ŵ
m
1
, m ≥ 1, are uniformly bounded
from above. For otherwise the trajectory φ[0,τ(xm)](xm) intersects Vσ for some σ ∈
Sing(G) ∩ U and accumulates σ. Hence, by the local behavior of trajectories near saddles
and the choice of the cross-sections near Vσ , we get that Ŵ˜ ⊂ 6i(a0) is not contained in
the boundary of the cross-section. This contradiction proves the claim. Let T be an upper
bound for τ(xm).

Then, for an accumulation point x ∈ Ŵ˜ of (xm)m≥1, we have that the trajectories
φ[0,T ](xm) converge in the C
1
topology (taking a subsequence if necessary) to a limit
curve φ[0,T ](x) and so f x = φτ(x)(x) ∈ ∂
s6i(a0). Thus we can find neighborhoods Wx of
x and Vf x of f x in 4 such that for arbitrarily large m we have that f | Wx : Wx → Vf x
is a diffeomorphism and Ŵ1 ∩ Wx = (f | Wx )
−1
(Vx ∩ ∂
s6i(a0)), which contradicts the
regularity of Ŵ1 as topological submanifold.
This concludes the proof of item (2) and the lemma.
Let us set 4′′ = 4(a0)\Ŵ from now on. Then 4′′ = S1 ∪ · · · ∪ Sm for some m ≥ 1,
where each Si
is a connected smooth strip, homeomorphic to either (i) Ddcu × Dds
if
Ŵ0 ∩ Closure Si = ∅; or (ii) Ddcu × (Dds \{0}) otherwise. The latter are singular (smooth)
strips.
We note that f | Si
: Si → 4(a0) is a diffeomorphism onto its image, τ | Si
: Si →
[T1, ∞) is smooth for each i, and τ | Si ≤ T1 + 2 on non-singular strips Si and also on
a neighborhood of ∂
s
(Si ∪ Ŵ0) for singular strips Si
. The foliation Ws
(4) restricts to a
foliation Ws
(Si) on each Si
.
Remark 2.12. In what follows it may be necessary to increase T1, leading to changes to
f, τ , Ŵ and {Si} (and the constant C in Lemma 2.9). However, the global cross-section
4 =
S
6yj
is fixed throughout the argument.
Remark 2.13. Since f sends 4′′ into 4 = 4(1), there are smooth extensions fei
: Sei → 4
of f | Si
: Si → 4, where S˜
i ⊃ Closure(Si)\Ŵ0.
2.4. Hyperbolicity of the global Poincaré map. We assume from now on that 3 is a
sectional-hyperbolic attracting set with dcu > 2 and proceed to show that, for large enough
T1 > 1, the global Poincaré map f : 4′′ → 4 is piecewise uniformly hyperbolic (with
discontinuities and singularities).
2.4.1. Hyperbolicity at each smooth strip. Let S ∈ {Si} be one of the smooth strips.
Then there are cross-sections 6, 6e ∈ 4 such that S ⊂ 6 and f (6) ⊂ 6e. The splitting TU0M = E

PROPOSITION 2.16. For any a > 0, λ1 ∈ (0, 1), we can increase T1 and shrink U1 such
that, if inf τ > T1 and x ∈ S and S, S

Remark 2.13 are such that on S˜

Propositions 2.14 and 2.16. In particular, δ1 = d(Si

3. The basin of sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets
Here we prove the topological part of the statement of Theorem C using first the following
technical result. The measure-theoretic part is dealt with in the next section; see §4.3.
THEOREM 3.1. There are finitely many (hyperbolic) periodic points p1, . . . , pl of 3 in
4 such that Ws = {Ws
x
(4) : x ∈ Wu
pi
(4); i = 1, . . . , l} is open and dense in 4 and, in
particular, S
i Wu
pi
(4) is dense in 4.
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2721
This is enough to deduce the topological part of Theorem C, since it implies that Wcs
is open and dense in U. In the rest of the section we prove Theorem 3.1.
3.1. Denseness of stable leaves of 3 on U
Proof of Theorem 3.1. In what follows we say that a C
1
(dcu − 1)-dimensional disk D ⊂ 6
such that TxD ⊂ C
u
x
(6, a) for all x ∈ D is a center-unstable disk, or just a cu-disk. A
cu-disk D is an unstable disk, or just a u-disk, if for any given x, y ∈ D there exists a
sequence fei
: S˜
i → 4 of smooth extensions of fi = f | Si
together with a subsequence ik
and xk, yk ∈ 4 such that gk = ffik
◦ f]ik−1 ◦ · · · ◦ fe2 ◦ fe1 satisfies gkxk = x, gkyk = y and
d(xk, yk) ≤ λ
ik
1
d(x, y) for all k ≥ 1 (note that an unstable disk is necessarily contained in
the attracting set 3).
From Remark 2.15, if S ⊂ 6y for some 6y ∈ 4, then D˜ = exp−1
y
(D) = Graph(g :
Du → E
s
y
(6)) where Du = πuD˜ ⊂ E
u
y
(6) is a open subset of E
u
y
(6y ) and g is a C
1
map such that kDgk ≤ 2a. Indeed, D is transverse to Ws
(6y ) and each Ws
x
(6y ) is the
graph of ϕx : B(0, ρ) ∩ E
s
y
(6y ) → E
u
y
(6y ) which is C
1
and depends continuously on x
in the C
1
topology; and the tangent space at any point of D˜ is contained in C
u
y
(6y , 2a).
We define ρ(D) = sup{r > 0 : B(x, r) ⊂ Du, x ∈ E
u
y
(6y )} as the inner radius of any
given cu-disk D.
We use uniform expansion along center-unstable cones by the extension of f to obtain
the following proposition.
PROPOSITION 3.2. There exist ρ0 > 0 and finitely many periodic points p1, . . . , pl of 3
in 4 such that any given center-unstable disk D0 contains a nested sequence D0 ⊃ Dˆ
1 ⊃
Dˆ
2 ⊃ . . . of disks admitting:
• a sequence fei
: S˜
i → 4 of smooth extensions; and
• a subsequence ik such that gk = ffik
◦ f]ik−1 ◦ · · · ◦ fe2 ◦ fe1 satisfies
gk | Dˆ
k : Dˆ
k → Dk = gkDˆ
k ⊂ 4 is a diffeomorphism for each k ≥ 1.
Moreover, (Dk)k≥1 accumulates a u-disk D in the C
1
topology which:
• contains the local unstable manifold Wu
q
(4) with respect to f of a point of q of the orbit
of pi
for some i ∈ {1, . . . , l}; and
• whose inner radius is uniformly bounded away from zero, ρ(D) ≥ ρ0.
We prove Proposition 3.2 in the next subsection. Since Ws
(4) is transversal to any
cu-disk and the nested disks Dˆ
k with vanishing diameter intersect at a unique point
r ∈ D0 ∩ 3, this shows that every center-unstable disk in any smooth strip contains the
transversal intersection of the stable manifold of all points in the local unstable manifold
of a periodic point of 3, completing the proof of Theorem 3.1.
3.2. Local uniform expansion of cu-disks. Here we fix a cu-disk D0 in S ∈ {Si} and
prove Proposition 3.2.
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
2722 V. Araujo
We obtain by induction a sequence of disks Dn, n ≥ 0 in 4 as follows. First, the inner
radius of any cu-disk contained in a smooth strip S˜ is uniformly expanded by the global
Poincaré map.
LEMMA 3.3. If λ2 ∈ (0, 1) satisfies 2λ1 < λ2(1 − 2a) and D is a cu-disk contained in
some extension S˜ of a smooth strip S ∈ {Si}, then
ρ(f D) ˜ ≥ λ
−1
2
ρ(D) and (1 − 2a)ρ(f D) ˜ ≤ 2diam(f D) ˜ ≤ (1 + 2a)ρ(f D) ˜ ,
where f˜ : S˜ → 4 is the extension of f | S : S → 4(a0).
Proof. Let S ⊂ 6y ∈ 4. From Remark 2.18, f D˜ is a cu-disk contained in some 6y
′ ∈ 4
and we can write exp−1
y
′ (f D) ˜ = Graph(g : D1
u → E
s
y
′(6y
′)) where D1
u ⊂ E
u
y
′(6y
′)
is an open subset. Then for a ball B(x′
, r) ⊂ D1
u
and C
1
curve γ1 : (I , 0, 1) →
(Closure B(x′
, r), x
′
, ∂B(x′
, r)) there exists a unique curve γ : I → Du = πu exp−1
y D
such that γ1(s) = πuf˜ expy
(γ(s) + g1γ(s)), where s ∈ I = [0, 1]. By Theorem 2.17 and
Remark 2.18, together with the choice of 6y , 6y
′ in Remark 2.6,
k ˙γ1(s)k = kπuDf˜ · D expy
(γ(s) ˙ + Dg1(γ(s)) · ˙γ(s))k
≥ λ
−1
1
kD expy
(γ(s) ˙ + Dg1(γ(s)) · ˙γ(s))k ≥
λ
−1
1
2
· (1 − 2a)k ˙γ(s)k.
Then the bound on the inner radius follows by the choice of λ2, since γ1 is any curve
joining γ1(0) = x
′
to the boundary γ1(1) ∈ ∂B(x′
, r) inside D1
u
. For the diameter, note
that ku − vk(1 − 2a) ≤ ku + g1u − (v + g1v)k ≤ (1 + 2a)ku − vk for all u, v ∈ D1
u
and
take account of the effect of expy
′ on distances; cf. Remark 2.6.
We let λ2 be as in the statement of Lemma 3.3 in what follows; fix λ2 < a1 < 1 and
assume without loss of generality that a1λ
−1
2 > 5. We assume that cu-disks D0, . . . , Dn
have already been obtained so that there are smooth strips S0, . . . , Sn satisfying Di ⊂
Sei ⊂ 6yi
and Di+1 ⊂ feiDi
, i = 0, . . . , n − 1.
Letting Dn = expyn
Graph(gn), we consider the balls B = {B(x, a1ρ(Dn)) ⊂
πu exp−1
yn Dn} and corresponding disks D = {D = expyn
Graph(gn | B), B ∈ B}. We
set Dˆ = {D ∈ D : ∃S, D ∩ ∂
sS 6= ∅} and Dˆ
σ = {D ∈ D : D ∩ Ŵ0 6= ∅}. Then we have
the following cases.
(1) If D 6⊆ Dˆ ∪ Dˆ
σ , then we choose some D ∈ D\(Dˆ ∪ Dˆ
σ ). There exists a smooth
section S such that D ⊂ S and we reset Dn = D and define Dn+1 = f Dn = (f |
S)(Dn) ⊂ 4(a0).
(2) Otherwise: either Dˆ 6= ∅ or Dˆ
σ 6= ∅.
(a) If Dˆ
σ 6= ∅, then we choose D ∈ Dˆ
σ and B ⊂ πu exp−1
yn D a ball of radius
a1ρ(Dn)/4 so that, resetting Dn = expyn
B, we have
d(Dn, Ŵ0) > (1 − 2a)ρ(Dn) and
ρ(Dn) = ρ(D)/4 > a1λ
−1
2
ρ(Dn−1)/4 > (5/4)ρ(Dn−1).
We then define Dn+1 = f Dn.
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2723
(b) Otherwise, we have Dˆ 6= ∅ = Dˆ
σ and consider the subfamily De = {D ∈ Dˆ :
∃S, D ∩ ∂
sS 6= ∅ 6= D ∩ ∂
sS˜} of those disks which intersect both ∂
sS and ∂
sS˜
for some S.
(i) If De = ∅, then we choose some D ∈ Dˆ and S so that D ∩ ∂
sS 6= ∅, reset
Dn = D, and define Dn+1 = f D˜
n, where f˜ is the extension of f | S
to S˜.
(ii) Otherwise, we choose D ∈ De. There exists a subdisk Dˆ ⊂ D such that
Dˆ ⊂ S˜ and ρ(D)ˆ ≥ a0δ1/2 by Remark 2.18 and the definition of δ1 and
Dˆ . We reset Dn = Dˆ and define Dn+1 = f D˜
n, with f˜ denoting the
extension of f | S to S˜.
This completes the inductive step of the construction of a sequence (Dn)n≥0 of cu-disks
in 4. Lemma 3.3 ensures that ρ(Dn+1) ≥ (a2λ
−1
2
/4)ρ(Dn) and a1λ
−1
2
/4 > 5/4 > 1 by
the choice of a1.
Since diam S < diam S˜ is bounded by a uniform constant for all smooth strips S ∈
{Si}, the expansion of the inner radius implies that the induction cannot go consecutively
through cases (1), (2a) or (2b)(i) above infinitely many times. Each time we are in case
(2b)(ii) we restart the algorithm, choosing a subdisk of Dn+1 with half the inner radius.
We conclude that, starting with any disk D0 as above, we obtain a subsequence nk ր ∞
so that Dnk
is in case (2b)(ii) and ρ(Dnk
) > a0δ1/2 for all k ≥ 1. Moreover, there exist
a subdisk D′
nk−1
with 2ρ(D′
nk−1
) = ρ(Dnk
) and an iterate f
mk such that f
mk
| D′
nk−1
:
D′
nk−1 → Dnk
is a diffeomorphism. In addition, the uniform bound on the diameter also
ensures that mk = nk − nk−1 is bounded: mk ≤ ¯m.
Finally, since 4 contains finitely many cross-sections, we can assume without loss of
generality that Dnk ⊂ 6y ∈ 4 for (possibly a subsequence of) all k. This is a sequence
of graphs of C
1
functions with uniformly bounded derivative and domains given by balls
with radius uniformly bounded away from zero. It follows that there exists a subsequence
of such disks uniformly converging to a cu-disk D in the C
1
-topology.
In particular, for large enough k, we have that the stable holonomy map h : D′
nk−1 →
Dnk within 6 is well defined by the choice of D′
nk−1
with half of the inner radius of
Dnk
and, moreover, is a continuous map; see Remark 2.4. Hence g = h ◦ (f mk
| Dnk
)
−1
:
Dnk → Dnk
has a fixed point by Brouwer’s fixed point theorem, that is, there exists a stable
leaf satisfying f
mkWs
x
(4) ⊂ Ws
x
(4). The contraction of stable leaves implies the existence
of a fixed point p of f
mk
| 6 which is a periodic point for the flow whose stable manifold
crosses Dnk
. Since we can take k as large as needed, we obtain that Ws
p
(6) transversely
crosses D also.
To complete the proof, since Dn+1 ⊂ fenDn by construction, if we set gn = fen ◦ · · · ◦
fe1, n ≥ 1, then we can find Dˆ
n+1 ⊂ D0 such that gnDˆ
n = Dn and Dn+1 ⊂ Dn, n ≥ 1.
Since Dnk → D uniformly as graphs, for x, y ∈ D there are xek, yek ∈ Dˆ
nk
such that
(gnk
xek, gnk
yek) → (x, y). By uniform expansion on cu-disks, for any given i ≥ 1 we get
d(gnk−ixek, gnk−iyek) ≤ λ
i
1
d(gnk
xek, gnk
yek) for all k ≥ 1. Thus, for an accumulation pair
(xi
, yi) of (gnk−ixek, gnk−iyek) and sequence g
i = fei ◦ · · · ◦ fe0 of f]nk−i ◦ · · · ◦ ffnk
as
k ր ∞, we get (gixi
, g
iyi) = (x, y) and d(xi
, yi) ≤ λ
i
1
d(x, y). Hence D is a u-disk as
claimed.
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
2724 V. Araujo
In addition, by the inclination lemma (λ-lemma of [41, Ch. 2, §7]), we can assume
without loss of generality that nk are multiples of mk for all large enough k and that
D ⊂ Wu
p
is a piece of the local unstable manifold of the hyperbolic periodic orbit p of
f, whose period is a divisor of mk. In particular, p is a hyperbolic periodic orbit for the flow
whose period τp is bounded: τp ≤ T = T (m)¯ .
This ensures the uniform size of the unstable manifold of the periodic orbits obtained
by the previous algorithm and, moreover, since their period is bounded, that the possible
periodic orbits are finite in number, by hyperbolicity and compactness.
This completes the proof of Proposition 3.2.
4. Finitely many ergodic physical measures for sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets
Here we prove Theorem A. We first obtain an auxiliary result which is a consequence of
the previous arguments on cu-disks contained in adapted cross-sections.
4.1. Uniformly center-unstable size of invariant subsets. We prepare the proof of
Theorem A by obtaining a result on uniform size of positively flow-invariant subsets in
the center-unstable direction.
We say that a dcu-dimensional C
1 disk D0 ⊂ U is a cu-disk if TxD0 ⊂ C
cu
x
(a) for all
x ∈ D (observe that such D is not contained in any cross-section 6 ∈ 4).
PROPOSITION 4.1. For a sectional-hyperbolic attracting set 3 of a C
1
vector field G,
there exists δ > 0 so that, given a positively G-invariant subset E ⊂ 3 having a cu-disk D
such that D ∩ E has full Lebesgue induced measure in D, there exists a cu-disk D˜ whose
inner radius is larger than δ and such that D˜ ∩ E has full Lebesgue induced measure
in D˜ . Moreover, there exists i ∈ {1, . . . , l} so that for any ε > 0 we can find D˜ as above
ε- C
1
-close to the local unstable manifold of O(pi), where the periodic point pi
is given
by Proposition 3.2.
Proof. This is a consequence of Proposition 3.2. Indeed, if E ⊂ 3 and D are as stated,
then we project D into D0 through the flow to the nearest cross-section, that is, for any
x ∈ D we consider t(x) = inf{t > 0 : φtx ∈ 4(a0)} and p(x) = φt(x)x, x ∈ D.
We claim that p(D) contains a cu-disk D0 inside some 6 ∈ 4 and, moreover, E ∩ D0
has full Lebesgue induced measure in D0.
Assuming this claim, then Dˆ
k ∩ E also has full Lebesgue induced measure in Dˆ
k for
each of the disks Dˆ
k ⊂ D0 provided by Proposition 3.2. Moreover, since the Poincaré
map f is a piecewise C
1 diffeomorphism as well as its extensions, Dk = gkDˆ
k is such
that Dk ∩ E also has full Lebesgue induced measure in Dk by invariance of E under all
transformations φt
, t ∈ R. The statement of Proposition 4.1 follows since, by construction,
(i) the cu-disks Dk have inner radius larger than some δ > 0 inside 6; (ii) fixing some
k ≥ 1, we have that D˜ = φ[−δ,δ](Dk) is a dcu-dimensional center-unstable disk for the
flow of G with inner radius bounded away from zero; and (iii) by smoothness of the
flow and invariance of E we have that D˜ ∩ E = φ[−δ,δ](Dk ∩ E) also has full Lebesgue
induced measure inside φ[−δ,δ](Dk). Moreover, the C
1
-closeness to the local unstable
manifold of one of the hyperbolic periodic orbits provided by Proposition 3.2 follows,
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2725
using the transversal intersection of the stable manifold of this orbit with D˜ together with
the inclination lemma.
It remains to prove the claim. Since D ⊂ U we have t(x) < ∞ for all x ∈ D and we fix
x0 ∈ D and y0 = p(x0) ∈ 6, for some adapted cross-section 6 ∈ 4(a0) in what follows,
where we assume without loss of generality that x0 is not a singularity.
We take a cross-section S to G at x0 and note that, since D is a cu-disk for the flow,
there exists a neighborhood V of x0 in M such that (i) p(V ) ⊂ 6 and (ii) S is transversal to
D ∩ V . So DS = S ∩ D ∩ V is a submanifold of M of codimension 1 + ds
. Hence, DS is
a submanifold of S of dimension dcu − 1 and a cu-disk inside S, that is, TxDS ⊂ C
cu
x
(a, S)
according to the definition of the induced center-unstable cone fields on a cross-section S.
Consequently, p(DS) is a cu-disk inside 6 and contained in p(D). It remains to show that
E has full Lebesgue induced measure in p(DS).
We now conveniently choose coordinates on a local chart of M at V so that S = R
d−1 ×

s = R

dcu , and also D ∩ V
is the graph of a C
1 map ϕ : R
dcu → R
ds
. Since 8 : {0
ds } × R
dcu → D ∩ V , u 7→ (ϕu, u)
is a C
1 diffeomorphism and E ∩ D ∩ V has full Lebesgue induced measure in D ∩ V , it
follows that E˜ = 8−1
(E ∩ D ∩ V ) has full Lebesgue measure in {0
ds } × R
dcu .
However, DS = 8({0
ds } × {R
dcu−1 × {0}) does not necessarily intersect E in a full
Lebesgue induced measure subset. But Fubini’s theorem ensures that E˜ ∩ {0
ds } ×
R
dcu−1 × {t} has full Lebesgue measure for Lebesgue almost every t ∈ R.
Thus we can choose t as close to 0 as needed so that St = R
d−1 × {t} is a cross-section
to G; Dt = St ∩ D ∩ V is a cu-disk inside St and E ∩ Dt has full Lebesgue induced
measure in Dt
. Moreover, we also have that p(Dt) ⊂ p(D) ⊂ 6 is a cu-disk inside 6
and p(Dt ∩ E) has full Lebesgue induced measure in p(Dt), since p | Dt
: Dt → p(Dt)
is a diffeomorphism as smooth as G.
This completes the proof of the claim with D0 = p(Dt) and Proposition 4.1 follows.
4.2. Uniform volume of ergodic basis of physical measures. We now extend the steps
presented in [28] together with Proposition 4.1 and the following result.
THEOREM 4.2 [20, Appendix: Corollary B.1 and Theorem I]. A C
1
vector field with
a sectional-hyperbolic attracting set 3 supports an SRB measure. More precisely, for
Lebesgue almost every point x in the trapping region of 3, any weak∗
limit measure of the
family (T −1
R T
0
δφt x dt)T >0 is an SRB measure. Moreover, if the vector field is Hölder-C
1
,
then each limit measure is a physical measure.
The above result states that any weak∗
accumulation point µ of the empirical measures
along the orbit of a Lebesgue generic point in U is an equilibrium state for the logarithm
of the center-unstable Jacobian, that is,
hµ(φ1) =
Z
log |det Dφ1 | E
cu| dµ > 0, (4.1)
the positiveness being a consequence of sectional hyperbolicity.
Moreover, if the flow is Hölder- C
1
, then this SRB measure is also a physical measure
since its support contains the (Pesin) unstable manifold through µ-a.e. point and the stable

2726 V. Araujo
foliation is absolutely continuous (this is a consequence of the partial hyperbolicity of
the attracting set, the fact that the vector field is Hölder-C
1
, and Proposition 2.3; this can
be seen by adapting known arguments from [42, 43]), following standard geometric and
ergodic arguments; see, for example, [28, §§2 and 3] and the proof of [20, Theorem I]. In
particular, the center-unstable manifold Wcu
x
through µ-a.e. x is a cu-disk contained in the
attracting set 3.
Remark 4.3. From Proposition 4.1, since the support of any SRB measure µ is a forward
invariant closed subset and contains a cu-disk, there exists a periodic orbit O(pi) contained
in supp µ for some i ∈ {1, . . . , l}. The stable leaves through the points of the local unstable
manifold Wcu
O(pi)
(ε0), for all small enough ε0 > 0, intersect each center-unstable manifold
through µ-a.e. point in an open subset, which contains µ-generic points by the absolute
continuity property of the stable foliation. In particular, this shows that no such periodic
orbit can be shared by distinct SRB measures of a sectional-hyperbolic attracting subset.
Proof of Theorem A. From Theorem 4.2 we have that any sectional-hyperbolic attracting
set for a C
1 flow admits some physical/SRB probability measure µ which we can assume,
without loss of generality, to be ergodic. Indeed, using ergodic decomposition, by Ruelle’s
inequality [31] we have hµ(φ1) ≤
R
log |det Dφ1 | E
cu| dµ and so if µ satisfies (4.1), then
each ergodic component of µ also satisfies (4.1)
Now we use that the ergodic basin B(µ) of µ contains a full Lebesgue measure subset
of some center-unstable disk D0 inside the sectional-hyperbolic attracting set together with
Proposition 4.1.
COROLLARY 4.4. Every sectional-hyperbolic attracting set 3 for a Hölder-C
1
vector field
admits ε0 > 0 so that the volume of the ergodic basin B(µ) of any ergodic SRB measure
µ supported in 3 is uniformly bounded away from zero: Leb(B(µ)) ≥ ε0.
Proof. By assumption, µ is an ergodic SRB measure and, as explained above, in our
setting the stable holonomies are absolutely continuous. Then by [28, Lemma 3.2] we
have that there exists a open subset V of the basin of attraction of 3 so that Leb-a.e. x ∈ V
is µ-generic, that is, Leb(V \B(µ)) = 0.
Hence there exists a cu-disk D0 ⊂ V such that D0 ∩ B(µ) has full Lebesgue induced
measure in D0. Proposition 4.1 implies that the positively invariant subset B(µ) contains a
cu-disk D with ρ(D) ≥ δ for some uniform δ > 0 depending only on 3. The same proof
of [28, Lemma 3.2], using the uniform size of local stable leaves of Ws
and the angle
between E
s
x
and E
cu
x
at x ∈ D uniformly bounded away from zero (due to domination),
implies that the set W =
S
{Ws
x
: x ∈ D} is open, diffeomorphic to a cylinder D × Dds of
uniform height. So Leb(W) ≥ ε0 for some uniform ε0 > 0. In addition, Leb-a.e. x ∈ W
belongs to B(µ) by the absolute continuity of the stable foliation.
We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem A. Let U be a trapping region
for 3. If Leb(U\B(µ)) = 0, then µ is the unique physical/SRB measure supported in 3.
Otherwise, let µ1 = µ and since U1 = U\B(µ1) is such that Leb(U1) > 0 we can use
[20, Theorem I] to ensure that Leb-a.e. x ∈ U1 belongs to the ergodic basin of some SRB
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2727
measure µ2 6= µ1. This measure µ2 is a physical measure, satisfies Leb(B(µ2)) > δ > 0
by Corollary 4.4, and B(µ1) ∩ B(µ2) = ∅ and B(µ1) ∪ B(µ2) ⊂ U.
Again, if Leb(U\(B(µ1) ∪ B(µ2))) = 0, then 3 supports exactly the pair µ1, µ2
of ergodic physical measures whose ergodic basins cover the topological basin of 3
except perhaps a Lebesgue zero subset. Otherwise U2 = U\(B(µ1) ∪ B(µ2)) is such that
Leb(U2) > 0 and we can repeat the argument.
Since the ergodic basins of distinct ergodic physical probability measures are disjoint
subsets of the trapping region U which has finite volume, and each ergodic basin has
a minimum volume bounded away from zero, this inductive process stops with finitely
many µ1, . . . , µk ergodic physical/SRB measures supported on 3, whose basins cover
the trapping region U, Leb mod 0. This completes the proof of Theorem A.
4.3. Full volume of stable leaves in the topological basin. Here we prove the
measure-theoretic part of the statement of Theorem C.
Let µ be an ergodic SRB measure supported in 3 for a Hölder-C
1 vector field, that
is, a physical measure. Let O(pi) be the hyperbolic periodic orbit contained in supp µ;
see Remark 4.3. Let V be an open neighborhood of O(p) and ϕ : M → R a non-negative
continuous function supported in V, so that µ(ϕ) =
R
ϕ dµ > 0. Hence
lim
T →∞
1
T
Z T
0
ϕ(φtx) dt = µ(ϕ) > 0 for each x ∈ B(µ).
Thus ϕ(φtx) > 0 for some t > 0 and so φtx ∈ V . This ensures that x ∈ Ws
y
for some
y ∈ Wcu
O(pi)
, that is, x ∈ Wcs for each x ∈ B(µ).
Finally, from Theorem A, there are finitely many ergodic SRB measures whose basins
cover Leb-a.e. point of U. This ensures that Leb(U\Wcs) = 0, and completes the proof of
the measure-theoretic part of the statement of Theorem C.
5. Statistical stability of sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets
Statistical stability is essentially a consequence of the existence of finitely many physical
measures whose basins cover Leb-a.e points of the trapping region together with recent
results from [40] on robust entropy expansiveness of sectional-hyperbolic attractors on
their trapping regions. We recall some relevant notions in what follows so as to be able to
present a proof of Theorem B in §5.4.
5.1. Entropy expansiveness. Let g : M → M be a continuous map and K a not necessarily invariant subset of M. For ε > 0 and n ≥ 1, the (ε, n)-dynamical ball around
x ∈ M is B(x, ε, n) = {y ∈ M : d(gj x, g
j y) < ε, ∀0 ≤ j < n}. A subset E ⊂ M is an
(n, ε)-generator for K if, given x ∈ K, there exists y ∈ E so that d(gix, g
iy) < ε for each
0 ≤ i < n. Equivalently, the dynamical ball {B(y, ε, n) : y ∈ E} is an open cover of K.
Let rn(K, ε) be the cardinality of the smallest (n, ε)-generator for K and r(K, ε) =
lim supn→∞(1/n) log rn(K, ε). The topological entropy of g on K is given by
htop(g, K) = lim
ε→0
r(K, ε),
and the topological entropy of g is defined by htop(g) = htop(g, M).
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2020.91 Published online by Cambridge University Press
2728 V. Araujo
For x ∈ M and ε > 0 we define the two-sided ε-dynamical ball at x as B(x, ε, ∞) =
{y : d(gnx, g
ny) < ε, ∀n ∈ Z} and say that g is ε-entropy expansive if all these infinite
dynamical balls have zero topological entropy, that is, supx∈Mhtop(g, B(x, ε, ∞)) = 0.
5.2. Upper semicontinuity of metric entropy. Let µ be a g-invariant measure and P a
finite µ mod 0 measurable partition. The metric entropy of µ with respect to the partition
P is given by
hµ(g, P) = inf
n≥1
1
n
Hµ(P
n
) where Hµ(P
n
) =
X
B∈Pn−1
−µ(B) log µ(B)
and P
n
is the nth dynamical refinement of P: P
n = P ∨ g
−1P ∨ · · · ∨ g
−(n−1)P. The
metric entropy of µ is hµ(g) = supPhµ(g, P) and the supremum is taken over all finite
measurable partitions.
If g is ε-entropy expansive, then every finite partition P with diam P < ε is generating,
that is, it satisfies hµ(g) = hµ(g, P) for all µ ∈ M
g
1
, where M
g
1
is the family of all
g-invariant probability measures; see, for example, [16].
The metric entropy of a vector field is the metric entropy of the time 1 map of its
induced flow. A vector field is ε-entropy expansive if the time-one map of its induced
flow is ε-entropy expansive.
Entropy expansiveness is a sufficient condition to ensure upper semicontinuity of the
entropy map µ ∈ M
g
1
7→ hµ(g), as follows.
LEMMA 5.1 [16]. If G is entropy expansive, then the metric entropy function is upper
semicontinuous.
5.3. Equilibrium states and physical measures. Since the family MG
1
of G-invariant
probability measures is compact in the weak∗
topology, for entropy expansive vector fields
there exists some measure which maximizes the function µ ∈ MG
1
7→ hµ(G) +
R
ψ dµ
for any given continuous function ψ : M → R, known as an equilibrium state for ψ, G.
In order to use equilibrium states to obtain statistical stability, we relate equilibrium
states for the potential ψ = log |det Dφ1 | E
cu| with physical measures in the same way
as for hyperbolic attracting sets; see, for example, [18].
THEOREM 5.2. Let 3 be a sectional-hyperbolic attracting set for a Hölder-C
1
vector field
G with the open subset U as trapping region.
(1) For each G-invariant ergodic probability measure µ supported in 3 the following
are equivalent:
(a) hµ(φ1) =
R
ψ dµ > 0;
(b) µ is an SRB measure, that is, it admits an absolutely continuous disintegration
along unstable manifolds;
(c) µ is a physical measure, that is, its basin B(µ) has positive Lebesgue measure.
(2) In addition, the family E of all G-invariant probability measures which satisfy
item (a) above is the convex hull E = {Pk
i=1
tiµi
:
P
i
ti = 1; 0 ≤ ti ≤ 1, i =
1, . . . , k}.

Sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets and statistical stability 2729
We recall that, from sectional hyperbolicity together with Ruelle’s inequality [48],
hν (φ1) ≤
R
ψ dν for all ν ∈ MG
1
. Hence, the set E defined above is formed by equilibrium
states for −ψ, G. The proof of Theorem 5.2 can be found in [9, §2.3] where the same
properties were stated and proved in the dcu = 2 setting (singular-hyperbolic attracting
sets). However, the proof presented there also holds in the present setting without
change.
5.4. Statistical stability. Here we prove Theorem B.
We consider vector fields G on a subset U of X
1+(M) with a trapping region U of
a sectional-hyperbolic attracting set 3G = 3G(U) =
T
t>0 φ
G
t
(U) so that each G ∈ U is
ε-entropy expansive. Then the map U → K(U), G 7→ 3G(U) is continuous, where K(U)
is the family of compact subsets of U with the Hausdorff distance between compact subsets
K, L ⊂ U of a metric space given by (see, for example, [22])
dH (K, L) = inf{r > 0 : K ⊂ B(L, r) and L ⊂ B(K, r)}.
LEMMA 5.3 [7, Lemma 2.3]. For every ε > 0 there is a neighborhood V of G in X
1
(M)
such that 3Y (U) ⊂ B(3G(U), ε) and 3G(U) ⊂ B(3Y (U), ε) for all Y ∈ V.
Moreover, the map ν ∈ M 7→ supp ν ∈ K(M) is also continuous, where M is the family
of probability measures in M with the weak ∗
topology. In addition, the domination of the
splitting E
s
3 ⊕ E
cu
3
implies its continuity for nearby vector fields; see, for example, [14,
Appendix B.1].
For any fixed G ∈ U and any sequence Gn ∈ U such that kGn − GkC1 → 0 when
n ր ∞, we let µn ∈ MGn
1
be equilibrium states for ψn, Gn, n ≥ 1, where ψn = ψGn =
log |det DφGn
1
| E
cu
3Gn
(U)|, and µ be a weak∗
limit point of (µn)n≥1. We assume that µ =
lim µn, restricting to a subsequence if necessary. Since the splitting E
s
3Gn
(U) ⊕ E
cu
3Gn
(U)
is continuous, we can deal with its continuous extension E
s
n ⊕ E
cu
n
to define ψn on the
whole of M.
The continuity of dominated splittings for nearby vector fields means that for each ξ > 0
there exist N ≥ 1 and a neighborhood V of supp µ such that
supp µn ⊂ V and dist(E∗
n,x
; E
∗
3G(U),x
) < ξ , x ∈ V , ∗ = s, cu, for all n > N;
where the distance dist(E, F) between two subspaces E, F of TxM is defined to be
dist(E, F) := max n
sup
kvk=1,v∈E
dist(v, F), sup
kvk=1,v∈F
dist(v, E)o
,
and dist(v, H) := minw∈E kv − wk for each subspace H of TxM and any x ∈ M.
Moreover, since DφGn
1
(x) converges to DφG
1
(x) uniformly in x when n ր ∞, we have
ψn → ψ = ψG uniformly by definition of the C
1
topology, in the following sense: for any
given ξ > 0 there exist N ≥ 1 and a neighborhood V of supp µ so that |ψn(x) − ψ(x)| <
ξ for all x ∈ V and each n > N.
Proof of Theorem B. Using the compactness of the manifold M, we construct a finite open
cover {B(xi
, δ) : i = 1, . . . , k} for some 2δ < ε such that µ(∂B(x, δ)) = 0, i = 1, . . . , k,
and obtain the partition P =
Wk
i=1 B(xi
, ε/2) with diameter smaller than ε and the

boundaries of each atom with zero µ-measure. Hence, for each k ≥ 1, we have that
µ(∂P
k
) = 0 since by continuity we have
∂P
n ⊂ ∂P ∪ ∂(φ−1P) ∪ · · · ∪ ∂(φ−k+1P) ⊂ ∂P ∪ φ−1∂P ∪ · · · ∪ φ−k+1∂P.
Now for each fixed k ≥ 1 we find that

where P

have that µ is a convex linear combination of the finitely many ergodic physical measures
supported in 3G(U) provided by Theorem A.
To complete the proof of Theorem B we present the proof of the lemma.
Proof of Lemma 5.4. Observe that

for all fixed k ≥ 1 and uniformly in x ∈ M. Moreover, we may assume without loss of

Since µ(∂P
