Modern compilers optimize memory access patterns to reduce cache misses through various techniques, 
such as loop unrolling, 
loop tiling, and data prefetching [1]. 
Loop unrolling reduces the overhead of loop control and increases instruction-level parallelism, 
while loop tiling improves spatial 
locality by dividing large data structures 
into smaller blocks that fit into the cache. Data prefetching involves predicting future memory 
accesses and loading data into 
the cache before it is actually needed, thereby reducing the latency associated with cache misses [2]. 
These optimizations are crucial for improving the performance of memory-bound applications on modern 
processors [3].
