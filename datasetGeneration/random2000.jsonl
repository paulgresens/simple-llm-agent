{"id":5520,"question":"What is the concept of Wannier functions?","answer":"Wannier functions are a way of expressing single electron excitations in a periodic potential. They were first proposed by Wannier in the 1960s as a means of understanding electronic structure in solids. The idea has since been revived in recent years and is often used in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) or other band structure methods.","arxiv":"1004.3934"}
{"id":13849,"question":"What is the significance of the parameter λ in the context of this paper?","answer":"The parameter λ is the coupling constant that enters the perturbative loop expansion in powers of the string coupling gs. It is related to the S-duality transformation law for τ=χ+ie−ϕ and is canonical, as in (2.1). The precise value of λ is not critical for the detailed comparison between S-duality and superstring perturbation theory, but its dependence on τ and τ¯ is crucial for the correct normalization of the 4-point function.","arxiv":"hep-th/0503180"}
{"id":13556,"question":"How does the NLC–SR contribute to the calculation of the γ∗γ→π0 process?","answer":"The NLC–SR directly contributes to this calculation by integrating its right-hand side with the weight 1/x. The smooth behavior of the NLC at the end points x=0,1, makes this integral well defined.","arxiv":"hep-ph/0103119"}
{"id":7523,"question":"How does the overlap improving multi-parameter reweighting technique work?","answer":"The overlap improving multi-parameter reweighting technique produces an ensemble of QCD configurations at μ=0 and at T≠0. Ferrenberg–Swendsen type reweighting factors of these configurations are determined at μ≠0 and at a lowered T. This process helps in studying lattice QCD at nonzero T and μ.","arxiv":"hep-lat/0208078"}
{"id":11689,"question":"What are the key results of the paper?","answer":"The paper establishes a connection between the studied scalar field models and the holographic dark energy, and reconstructs the potentials for each model. The results favor the proposed infrared cut-off as a viable phenomenological model of holographic density.","arxiv":"0810.3663"}
{"id":2851,"question":"What is the significance of the operator 12Aa2μ in Yang–Mills theories?","answer":"The operator 12Aa2μ is the dimension two composite operator in Yang–Mills theories, and it is known that it has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. This operator is of interest because it may play a key role in understanding confinement in these theories.","arxiv":"hep-th/0211144"}
{"id":10431,"question":"How does the paper propose to address the cosmological constant problem?","answer":"The paper suggests that the entropy bound has immediate implications for the cosmological constant problem. In conventional quantum field theory, the quantum corrections to the vacuum energy are typically divergent. However, by making specific assumptions, the paper proposes a way to estimate the natural size of the correction to the cosmological constant.","arxiv":"hep-th/0403052"}

It operates at a temperature of -70°C and has a field of view of about 30μm.","arxiv":"1004.1313"}
{"id":3567,"question":"How does the paper relate the source term to the perturbation of the conformal field theory?","answer":"The source term, ∫dxαO, added to the quantum field theory action, can be viewed as a single-trace perturbation of the theory. In the AdS/CFT calculation, one identifies one of the boundary data φ̂ or φ̌ with the source α.","arxiv":"hep-th/0201100"}
{"id":7204,"question":"What is the importance of the 23 block of the neutrino mass matrix?","answer":"The 23 block of the neutrino mass matrix is of particular importance in explaining the observed pattern of oscillations. As per the paper, the determinant of this block is of order (λ 2) in units of (v u 2/λ 2 Λ)2, which gives rise to the desired hierarchy between atmospheric and solar frequencies.","arxiv":"hep-ph/9907532"}
{"id":10397,"question":"What are the possible implications of a dipole deviation from isotropy in the cosmic ray data?","answer":"A dipole deviation from isotropy would indicate that there is a preferred direction in the distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions. This could be a significant finding, as it would suggest a preferred structure or source distribution.","arxiv":"astro-ph/0004016"}
{"id":4246,"question":"How does the soft-breaking Lagrangian influence the FCNCs?","answer":"The soft-breaking Lagrangian, which includes the scalar mass and the trilinear interaction terms, influences the FCNCs. It can generate O(1) t̃–c̃ mixings, which are consistent with theoretical bounds from avoiding charge-color breaking and maintaining vacuum stability.","arxiv":"hep-ph/0103178"}
{"id":12207,"question":"What is the relevance of the boundary condition at the brane in the context of this study?","answer":"The boundary condition at the brane follows from the linearly perturbed junction conditions. It imposes constraints on the metric perturbations on the brane, and in particular, it requires that the stresses on the brane obey the equation of state.","arxiv":"hep-th/0006007"}
{"id":7801,"question":"What is the role of gauge mediation in the context of the paper?","answer":"Gauge mediation is considered because it provides a solution to the flavor problem. It involves the introduction of vector-like messenger particles that carry standard model quantum numbers. However, the simplicity model has a supersymmetric and hence global minimum where S=0 and q=q¯=μ2/λ.","arxiv":"hep-ph/0607090"}
