{"id":6684,"question":"What is the significance of the Lyapunov coefficient in the analysis of chaotic maps?","answer":"The Lyapunov coefficient (λ) represents the rate of growth or decay of the distance between two neighbouring orbits of a map in each iteration. In the analysis, it is used to determine the stability of full synchronization in the ensemble of chaotic maps.","arxiv":"1004.3509"}
{"id":675,"question":"Can you generate sufficient CP violation with only one extra dimension?","answer":"It is not possible to generate sufficient CP violation with only one extra dimension. This is because, in the Standard Model, both the NNI and triangular forms correspond to a choice of WB, and starting from arbitrary mass matrices, one can always perform transformations that diagonalize the Yukawa matrices while leaving the weak currents diagonal in flavour space.","arxiv":"hep-ph/0012289"}
{"id":755,"question":"How are the global charges and the magnetic moment of a black hole obtained?","answer":"The mass, angular momenta, and the electric charge of the black holes are obtained from the Komar expressions associated with the respective Killing vector fields. The global charges and the magnetic moment can also be obtained from the asymptotic expansions of the metric and the gauge potential.","arxiv":"hep-th/0605075"}

{"id":5520,"question":"What is the concept of Wannier functions?","answer":"Wannier functions are a way of expressing single electron excitations in a periodic potential. They were first proposed by Wannier in the 1960s as a means of understanding electronic structure in solids. The idea has since been revived in recent years and is often used in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) or other band structure methods.","arxiv":"1004.3934"}
{"id":13556,"question":"How does the NLC–SR contribute to the calculation of the γ∗γ→π0 process?","answer":"The NLC–SR directly contributes to this calculation by integrating its right-hand side with the weight 1/x. The smooth behavior of the NLC at the end points x=0,1, makes this integral well defined.","arxiv":"hep-ph/0103119"}
{"id":7523,"question":"How does the overlap improving multi-parameter reweighting technique work?","answer":"The overlap improving multi-parameter reweighting technique produces an ensemble of QCD configurations at μ=0 and at T≠0. Ferrenberg–Swendsen type reweighting factors of these configurations are determined at μ≠0 and at a lowered T. This process helps in studying lattice QCD at nonzero T and μ.","arxiv":"hep-lat/0208078"}
