[{'sentence': 'Quantum computing is a new paradigm that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations and operations on data, and it has the potential to compromise many existing cryptographic schemes, such as RSA and ECC, by efficiently solving specific mathematical problems like integer factorization and discrete logarithms.', 'documentId': 1}, {'sentence': 'The rise of quantum computing demands a shift towards post-quantum cryptographic methods, which are designed to be secure against both classical and quantum computers, and examples of such methods include lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, hash-based cryptography, and multivariate polynomial cryptography.', 'documentId': 1}, {'sentence': 'Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method of secure communication that enables two parties to share a secret key, and its security is based on the fundamental law of quantum mechanics, namely that information gain generally implies disturbance on quantum states, which can be detected by the communicating parties.', 'documentId': 4}, {'sentence': 'The BB84 protocol is a well-known QKD protocol that uses a quantum channel and a public classical channel to distribute a secret key between two parties, and its security is based on the fact that any attempt by an eavesdropper to measure the quantum signals will introduce errors that can be detected by the legitimate parties.', 'documentId': 4}, {'sentence': 'Quantum cryptography has the potential to provide unconditional security, which is guaranteed by the laws of physics, and it can be used to complement conventional cryptography, rather than replacing it entirely, and to provide a higher level of security for sensitive information.', 'documentId': 4}]...
